Some ways to keep your relationship with technology mindful v.001


### Router/Network Level Settings:
 - Set your router's DNS settings to use [Cloudflare for Families](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/)
 - [Advanced] Set your router's DNS settings to use a customizable DNS provider like AdGuard Home or PiHole. Certain sites can be blocked at the DNS layer this way, which makes management easier if you have many devices in your household.

### Browser Level Settings & Extensions

### Other Ideas
 - Refrain from keeping electronic devices in bedrooms (charge them in communal areas)
 - Designate certain spaces in your home that are electronics free
 - Try to keep computer and video game use tethered to devices that can't be moved (desktop computers or consoles). Keep them in open, highly trafficked areas.
 - Try to make activities like video games social (more than one player at a time) and encourage problem solving and in-person cooperative games/play versus one player online play.
