In my work with [New Canaan Unplugged](https://www.newcanaanunplugged.org/), I am often asked for ways that help me maintain a mindful relationship with technology. Here is a brief collection of some ideas I have given those who have asked.

### Use Router/Network Level Settings to block desired content:
 - Set your router's DNS settings to use [Cloudflare for Families](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/)
 - [Advanced] Set your router's DNS settings to use a customizable DNS provider like AdGuard Home or PiHole. Certain sites can be blocked at the DNS layer this way, which makes management easier if you have many devices in your household.

### Limit notifications and extra distractions at the device level
- Turn off *ALL* notifications on *all* devices, unless absolutely critical (texts, calls from family). Enable as needed after this point (as opposed to default opt in).
- Enable Grayscale mode on your phone. Set up a hardware button shortcut if you are using iOS to toggle this setting on/off. 
- Use iOS "Focus modes" to hide distracting apps, widgets from your view and change notification settings for specific activities as needed.

### Browser Level Settings & Extensions
- Use an Ad Blocker like UBlock Origin to block ads (including video ads on Youtube)
- Disable WebRTC
- Clickbait Remover for Youtube will replace clickbail thumbnails with actual thumbnails from the Youtube video.
- Enhancer for Youtube will help reduce things like recommendations and autoplay on Youtube, which are all designed to get users to spend more time on the site.
- Unhook - Remove Youtube Recommended videos and Shorts across the site.

### On AI Tooling
- Use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and [WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) to locally run an open source LLM of choice (such as Llama). While these toolsets aren't quite as compelling as ChatGPT might seem, I find they are sufficient for general purpose use of LLMs and have the advantage of not leaking personal data to large AI companies that are continuing to use user input to train their models.

### Other Ideas
 - Refrain from keeping electronic devices in bedrooms (charge them in communal areas or near the entry/exit to the home).
 - Designate certain spaces in your home that are electronics free.
 - Try to keep computer and video game use tethered to devices that can't be moved (desktop computers or consoles). Keep them in open, highly trafficked areas.
 - Try to make activities like video games social (more than one player at a time) and encourage problem solving and in-person cooperative games/play versus one player online play.

### List of recommended couch/co-op games

 - Super Smash Bros Ultimate (Switch)

 - Overcooked, Overcooked 2 (PC, Switch)
