Here's a list of some useful Bitcoin and Blockchain related reading that I've found has helped shape my perspective on both technologies. This doc is a WIP.

#### Start Here
- [Satoshi's white paper][1]
- Tim Ferris, Naval Ravikant and Nick Szabo give you a crash course in Crypto[https://tim.blog/2017/06/04/nick-szabo/][2]
- Juan Benet talks through IPFS, app-coins, and Web3 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUVLuXjPAfg][3]

#### Protocols
- [Bitcoin as a "fat" protocol vs. "thin" protocols likes TCP/IP"][5]. Good post from Joel Monegro @ USV. The kicker: "the market cap of the protocol always grows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top, since the success of the application layer drives further speculation at the protocol layer. And again, increasing value at the protocol layer attracts and incentivises competition at the application layer. Together with a shared data layer, which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry, the end result is a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of applications and the bulk value distributed to a widespread pool of shareholders. This is how tokenized protocols become “fat” and its applications “thin”."

#### General Reading
- Blockchain application stack: http://joel.mn/post/103546215249/the-blockchain-application-stack and http://joel.mn/post/104755282493/the-shared-data-layer-of-the-blockchain
- Blockchain w/o bitcoin: https://prestonbyrne.com/2015/04/08/blockchain-without-bitcoin-is-now-a-thing/
- Bitcoin categories: http://cdixon.org/2014/03/13/four-categories-of-bitcoin-inspired-projects/
- Logically centralized but organizationally decentralized: http://continuations.com/post/105272022635/bitcoin-clarifying-the-foundational-innovation-of
- Where the "chain" piece comes from: http://thegongshow.tumblr.com/post/93146109030/blockchain-origins

#### Companies & technology I find interesting
 - https://axoni.com/ - founder is a Cornell guy (super smart)
 - Blockstack (blockchain infrastructure to build web apps with)
 - Mediachain (media attribution and metadata via the blockchain)
 - [Steemit][6] - reddit but powered by the blockchain
- IPFS

#### Interesting Moments In the History of BitCoin

- On the block size debate & infrastructure:
- On lightning networks:
- On sidechains:
  - https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/19/bitcoin-2-0-unleash-the-sidechains/
- On bitcoin governance issues:


#### People To Follow & Place to Chat
- Albert Wegner - Albert is a big fan of decentralization and all things that come with it. He looks at the blockchain/bitcoin through the lens of an investor but also someone who is intimately aware of the power of networked technology.
- Bitcoin Subreddit
- Medichain slack group
- Blockstack slack group
