### Reykjavik
  - [Hotel Kvosin](http://kvosinhotel.is/): super cool apartment style hotels with a mini fridge/kitchen. Very new/clean and in the center of Rekjavik.

  - Hallgrímskirkja church. Super cool architecture. If you want pictures, get there early in the day and you'll have it all to yourself.

  - Harpa Concert Hall: beautiful architecture. Walk inside - there are also tours and a restaurant inside.

<!--   - MUSEUM: THE CULTURE HOUSE : Hverfisgata 15, Reykjavik -->
  - [Icelandic Penis Museum](http://phallus.is/en/): This exists and is hilarious/bizarre. It's a quick trip but pretty interesting.
  
  - Hot dogs (the perfect follow up to penis museum) at [Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur](https://foursquare.com/v/b%C3%A6jarins-beztu-pylsur/4b0c4d00f964a520ce3a23e3) are tasty

  - Reykjavik Art Museum - there are three of these scattered across the city. One ticket gets you into all three on the same day. Really nice to walk the city and see the art!

<!--  - Mokka for Coffee - good coffee, particular the Mocha, they use legit chocolate, also their breakfast menu is off the chain. try the big slice of toast with marmalade and cheese. it's a strange icelandic breakfast thing, delicious.-->
 - [Bergsson Mathus](http://www.bergsson.net/mathus): awesome breakfast place. We went there every single morning in Reykjavik.
<!--  - Tapas Barinn for dinner! -->

  - Saegreifinn - The Sea Baron -- super legit, super delicious, make sure you try the bisque, you can't really go wrong with anything. *We didn't go - but friends have been*

  - Noodle Station & Ramen Momo if you're looking for ramen/noodles.

  - Don's Donuts: late night donut cart. Perfect for the 1am hot donuts.

  - Icelandic Fish and Chips - delicious fish and chips. Pick a ton of different dipping sauces and fresh fish varies daily. Highly recommended.

  - [Fiskfelagid Fish Company](http://www.fiskfelagid.is/en/)

### Golden Circle & Surrounding Area

- Gullfoss - Big waterfall. The first of MANY.

- Geysir - A natural geysir that shoots water from the ground every 10 mins

- Bruarfoss waterfall - Awesome looking waterfall with electric blue water

- Laugarvatn Fontana Natural steam rooms and geothermal baths. $25 entry

- UNESCO Þingvellir National Park (“Thingvellir”): Continental plates of Europe and America meet here.

- Hike Reykjadalur (45mins) and find some hot pools to swim in – one of the few and may not be technically open to the public. [Many blog posts on how to get here](http://www.fontana.is/en/openinghoursandservices). An unmanaged hotsprings, you can swim wherever you want. Find where the hot water meets the cold water, this is the best temperature.

- UNESCO Þingvellir National Park

- Háifoss Waterfall

- Hekla Volcano - spent some time 4-wheeling off road trying to get near Hekla & Landmannalaugar. Tough to get to, so maybe take a guide or an even bigger 4WD (capable of crossing rivers).

- Landmannalaugar - hard to get to but apparently beautiful. We got 90% of the way there before turning back. :(

### Between Reykjavik & Vik

 - Hotel: [Frost and Fire Guesthouse](https://foursquare.com/v/frost-and-fire-guesthouse/4fe0423ce4b066c019e39608), [Thorsmork Volcano Huts (didn't go but would love to)](Thorsmork Volcanco Huts: http://www.volcanohuts.com/check-availability/)
- Dyrholaey - lots of birds, can see Reynisdrangar from here.
- Reynisdrangar - giant rock structures in the ocean, and very cool natural perfect cubic rock formations in the cliff side near Vik
- Reynisfjara: Black sand beach near Vik with some crazy geometric cliffs and big jagged rock formations offshore

- Seljalandsfoss: A beautiful waterfall that you can see from the ring road but is actually a 100 metres off the ring road. It's possible to walk around the waterfall

- Skogafoss Waterfall Right next to Seljalandsfoss
- Lunch: [Mia's Country Grill - Local Fish And Chips](https://foursquare.com/v/mias-country-grill--local-fish-and-chips/57338a1a498e2a1fb0514b8f) truck on the way into Skogafoss. EXCELLENT.

- Thórsmörk (requires 4WD): Good long hike: Fimmvörðuháls Pass from Thorsmork to Skógafoss

- Sólheimasandur Beaches w/ abandoned plane: between Skógafoss waterfall and the town of Vik.

### Between Vik & Hofn

 - Fjadrargljufur Canyon: short hike and really scenic canyon. About a 20 minute detour off highway 1 on the way to Skaftafell from Vik. Hike is only an hour or two.

 - Skaftafell National Park (and Islands)

 - Glacier walk – Skaftafell (http://www.glacierguides.is/equipment-list)

 - Eldhraun Lava Field in Skftafell park (didn't make it but would love to go back/have heard it's awesome)

 - Svartifoss waterfall (or the black waterfall) - easy to get to off of highway 1 (approx 200 meters away). Hike up to the falls can be extended to see views of surrounding glaciers, etc. Good half-day hike.

  - Food: [Shell Freysnes](https://foursquare.com/v/shell-freysnes/5033e875e4b0478e59b5245d)Gas station right outside Skaftafell has tasty burgers. Trust me on this one.

 - Vatnajökull National Park (Vatnajokulsthjodgardur)

 - Jokulsaron Glacier lagoon - THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST. Incredibly gorgeous. Come back again if you don't see the icebergs floating out to sea the first time.

 - [Fosshotel Vatnajokull](http://www.fosshotel.is/hotels/fosshotel-in-the-south-east/fosshotel-vatnajokull/): newly renovated. Funky service but great location if you're going to explore Vatnajokull area. Close to Hofn.

  - Dinner: [Humarhofnin](http://www.humarhofnin.is/) - hope you like [lobster](https://irs1.4sqi.net/img/general/width960/40093_q7vDbe0iE0iGkMKiY4bOgSrzghPwu1_eUoU74_tCV9o.jpg). Theirs is excellent.



### Akureyri & North (Diamond Circle)

- Dettifoss: Massive waterfall. Where the beginning of Prometheus was filmed. Be prepared for cold, wind, and snow. But it's awesome.

- Hverir Thermal Fields

- [Myvatn Baths](http://www.myvatnnaturebaths.is/en/lagoon): Better than the Blue Lagoon, even on a cold day.

- Dimmuborgir: Right next to Mývatn, Dimmuborgir is an area filled with dramatic rock formations and caves and often referred to as a gateway to Hell.

- Dinner: Vogafjos Cowshed Cafe in Myvatn.

- Goðafoss Falls at sunset is beautiful

- In Akureyri: [Akureyrarkirkja](www.akirkja.is): (A landmark church)

### More Stuff: Maybe next time?

 - Thrihnukagigur - volcano you can go inside of. Also sort of looks like a tourist trap.

 - Crystal Caves at Vatnajökull: in the winter you can go caving in the glacier. Sounds and looks beautiful, but dangerous in the summer months.

 - [UNESCO Site: Surtsey Island](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1267)
