Here's a list of some useful Bitcoin and Blockchain related reading that I've found has helped shape my perspective on both technologies.

#### Protocols
- [Bitcoin as a "fat" protocol vs. "thin" protocols likes TCP/IP"](https://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols).
> Good post from Joel Monegro @ USV. The kicker: "the market cap of the protocol always grows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top, since the success of the application layer drives further speculation at the protocol layer. And again, increasing value at the protocol layer attracts and incentivises competition at the application layer. Together with a shared data layer, which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry, the end result is a vibrant and competitive ecosystem of applications and the bulk value distributed to a widespread pool of shareholders. This is how tokenized protocols become “fat” and its applications “thin”."
