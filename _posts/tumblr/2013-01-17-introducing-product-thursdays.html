<p><span>Ever since I was a kid, I spent hours clicking around on computers, obsessed with learning the ins and outs of whatever OS, application, or web product I discovered at the time. I remember when I got my first Windows laptop after years of using a Mac, I explored every little system setting and tweaked ini files so I could get an experience that was exactly what I wanted. Over time, this obsession with technology guided me to study CS in college and subsequently work in tech.</span></p>
<p>Though I have experience interacting with consumers (at <a href="http://shelby.tv">Shelby</a>) and businesses (at <a href="http://mckesson.com">McKesson</a>) using vastly different kinds of tech products, I have relatively modest training (other than my hands-on experience) on the fundamentals that inform great product design and the process required to effectively manage larger product teams.  In my effort to become more well-versed in the history and community of the product, I thought I&#8217;d start a weekly post on product to share my findings with the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus begins Product Thursdays. If there&#8217;s stuff you&#8217;d love to see, drop me an <a href="mailto:ckurdziel+product@gmail.com">email</a> with a suggestion!  Otherwise, here&#8217;s a list of where I&#8217;ll probably head with this:</p>
<ol><li><span><strong>Product Resources</strong> - What are some great sources for learning/self-study about product design?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Product Process</strong> - What companies are known for building awesome products and how do they do it?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Product Examples</strong> - What are the best examples of products that I&#8217;m currently enjoying and why do I think they&#8217;re awesome? </span></li>
</ol>
