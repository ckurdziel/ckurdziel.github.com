title: Hello World!
---
I’ve wrestled with the idea of blogging for a while now.  While I’m not the world’s most prolific or profound writer, I find that expressing myself via written word is a useful exercise in developing my ideas (many of which never leave the grey matter they are conceived in). I’ve also been inspired at the community my friend Steve has created over on his blog, [NerdFitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com "NerdFitness").  My goal here is not to attract the level of readership that Steve has (although I certainly wouldn’t complain if I do).  Rather, I hope to articulate some commentary and ideas on topics that are dear to me. Perhaps, in this process, I’ll attract a few others who also share my passion for these topics and we’ll engage in some discourse and discussion along the way.
