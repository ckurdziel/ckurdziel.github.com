<p>I&#8217;ve toyed around with the idea of doing a Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to NYC Tech (<a href="http://www.robgo.org/post/1525018376/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-boston-tech-community">much like Rob Go has done for the Boston community</a>) for a while now.  The New York tech community is growing like a weed and it&#8217;s becoming harder to keep track of everything going on.  Hopefully this guide will help students, aspiring techies, and veterans all find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">answer</a> to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.</p>
<p>Rather than compile all of the information into one gigantic post, I&#8217;ll be breaking things up into a series of posts which I will keep updated over time.  Feedback and thoughts are welcome in the comments!</p>
<p>To kick things off, here&#8217;s a list of incubators, co-working spaces, and accelerators in the New York City area.  I&#8217;ve included brief descriptions for each.  If there are any awesome places I&#8217;m missing, please leave a comment and let me know!</p>
