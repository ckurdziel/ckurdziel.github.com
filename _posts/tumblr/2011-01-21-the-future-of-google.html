<p>Anyone who has checked Twitter (or any tech new source) in the past 24 hours has heard the news about Google&#8217;s Eric Schmidt stepping aside as CEO.  I can&#8217;t speak for what those inside Google would say (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Eric-Schmidt">that&#8217;s what Quora is for</a>), but from the outside, it looks like this is a good thing for the company and probably even a little late.</p>
<p>Google seems to have lost their direction lately and have made more news for their <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/12/dishwashers_dem.html">increasingly irrelevant search results due to content farms</a> rather than the awesome products that drew people to them in the first place.  It&#8217;s good to see Larry back in charge of the company he helped build and I think it sends a strong message to Google employees that they might see a renewed focus on the things that made Google such a dynamic company in its early days.  It will be interesting to see whether Larry&#8217;s return as CEO will also help keep strong engineering talent from migrating to Facebook, Apple and others that pose a threat to Google. </p>
<p>Albert at USV has written <a href="http://continuations.com/post/2857077313/rooting-for-larry-and-the-internet">a nice post about what he hopes to see from Larry</a>, and I have to say that I hope for the same.  Google has an opportunity to remain an &#8220;equalizer" and advocate for openness on the Internet and in the mobile space (and, yes, still be hugely profitable).  While I love my iPhone, I think that a cloud space dominated by closed, proprietary technology (Apple, Facebook, etc.) is ultimately an unhealthy place for consumers and new innovation.  As Albert puts it, Google can &#8220;figure out how to succeed by making others succeed." Here&#8217;s to hoping.</p>
