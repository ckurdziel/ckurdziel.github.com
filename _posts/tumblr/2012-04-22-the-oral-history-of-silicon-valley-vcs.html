<p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/zdanielshi">friend of mine</a> recently discovered <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/vc/transcripts.html">this archive</a> of interview transcripts of many of Silicon Valley&#8217;s seminal venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Considering most of the guys on this list started their respective firms before the widespread adoption of the internet, I think it&#8217;s pretty cool to think about how this stuff was documented. In many cases, some of the details are much more intimate as a result of being recounted in a more informal fashion.  </p>
<p>Don Valentine (founder of Sequoia Capital) doesn&#8217;t keep a blog or have a Facebook page, but he did sit down and <a href="http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/valentine_donald.pdf">orally recount much of his history</a>, which is documented in these archives.  It&#8217;s a fascinating read (both from a personal and a professional perspective) if you have the time to look through some of it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fun excerpt from his interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valentine: I don’t believe in business school.</p>
<p>Hughes: Why?</p>
<p>Valentine: We have people here at Sequoia who went to business school, but most of the primary partners here have not gone to business school. Or said differently, and this is a true story, when asked where I went to business school, I said, “Fairchild Semiconductor.” And the people said, “We’ve never heard of it.” I was talking to people who thought that if you didn’t go to Harvard Business School you could never learn how to manage money. And my rejoinder was I was not interested in learning how to raise money; I was interested in building great companies, and I didn’t have to go Harvard Business School to build great companies.</p>
