title: 'Hitchhiker''s Guide to NYC Tech Part 1: The Places'
---
I’ve toyed around with the idea of doing a Hitchhiker’s Guide to NYC Tech ([much like Rob Go has done for the Boston community](http://www.robgo.org/post/1525018376/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-boston-tech-community)) for a while now.  The New York tech community is growing like a weed and it’s becoming harder to keep track of everything going on.  Hopefully this guide will help students, aspiring techies, and veterans all find the [answer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)) to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Rather than compile all of the information into one gigantic post, I’ll be breaking things up into a series of posts which I will keep updated over time.  Feedback and thoughts are welcome in the comments!

To kick things off, here’s a list of incubators, co-working spaces, and accelerators in the New York City area.  I’ve included brief descriptions for each.  If there are any awesome places I’m missing, please leave a comment and let me know!

- [Dogpatch Labs](http://dogpatchlabs.com/) - Co-working space run by Polaris Ventures.
- [General Assembly](http://www.generalassemb.ly/) - Co-working space.  They offer classes, hack days, and a host of other events, though there is typically a cost associated.

- [TechStars NYC](http://www.techstars.org/nyc/) - Seed accelerator that operates out of Pivotal Labs just south of Union Square.  Pivotal Labs also hosts a number of after-hours tech-related events.  Probably the most impressive of all NYC’s accelerators.
