<p>Lots of startups (especially those in NYC) spend a ton of time on visual design and making sure that the look and feel of their product is close to perfect.Â </p>
<p>While my obsessive tendencies often encourage me to consider every design option presented, I&#8217;ve had to remember that too much attention to design can often get in the way of moving a product forward.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a startup trying to iterate quickly, understand your customer base and think about things as an MVP, there are times when it&#8217;s smart to eschew design for shipping product (provided it doesn&#8217;t cripple functionality). That extra bit of design/attention to detail can be helpful, for sure, but a good product person should understand when that matters and when it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
