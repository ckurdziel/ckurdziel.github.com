<p>I used to hate running.</p>
<p>About a week and a half ago (yeah, I know this post is late), I had the pleasure of running the 42nd ING NYC Marathon along with a few of my colleagues at <a href="http://shelby.tv">Shelby.tv</a> and a few classmates at Cornell.  Aside from the obvious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">numerical significance</a> of the event, my 26.2 mile journey gave me a chance to think about what the whole experience of training, fundraising and running has done for me personally.</p>

<p>Unlike a few of my <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/post/10733513796/ok-heres-episode-2-from-last-week-we-got-a">compadres</a> at Shelby, I&#8217;ve never considered myself much of an athlete. I didn&#8217;t have a time goal for the marathon - instead my focus was on running the entire 26.2 miles and making it across the finish line.</p>
<p>Looking back on the day, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful that my legs held out and that I was able to finish the race.  Though my time wasn&#8217;t the best, I&#8217;m definitely proud of the fact that my splits actually got faster during each subsequent mile.  Some more experienced marathoners have told me that this is a pretty tough thing to do, so I guess that means I did something right. As many who have run marathons will tell you, the last six miles are brutal (at any pace) and in that final stretch, I discovered I had more mental fortitude than I thought to <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/10/25/love-this-pic-as-someone-who-works-for-a-startup-and-is-running-the-marathon-lets-hope-i-finish-i-agreearainertwith-the-nyc-marathon-a-few-weeks-away-november-6th-people-make-sure-you-get-out-there-and.html">finish</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the mental (and obvious physical) benefits of running a marathon, I was lucky enough to participate in the <a href="http://www.teamintraining.org/">Team in Training program</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma society</a>. My grandfather died from lymphoplasmactic lymphoma a few years ago and I wanted to honor his memory and support a cause that is dear to my heart.  There were definitely a few moments during the run on Sunday when I spent a lot of time reflecting on how lucky I am to be in good health and to be able to run such an amazing race.  Thanks to everyone - family, friends and others - who took the time to support me in raising money for this cause.  I can&#8217;t thank you enough - you helped <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/nyc11/bigred">our team become the top fundraising family &amp; friends team in the NYC chapter for Team in Training</a>!</p>
<p>Over the course of my run, I ran into a bunch of people I met in NY tech this summer, family, friends and a few thousand new faces as well. Much like my experience in NY tech, I&#8217;ve found that my level of success and happiness is really tightly coupled with the awesome people I surround myself with.  With that in mind, thanks to everyone in NYC for coming out and supporting all of the runners.  Never thought I&#8217;d say this&#8230;but&#8230;I don&#8217;t think this was my last marathon.</p>
