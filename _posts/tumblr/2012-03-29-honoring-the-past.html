<p>Yesterday I was driving to NYC with my buddy <a href="http://www.punylittlehuman.com/">Daniel</a> for <a href="http://www.blueprinthealth.org/">Blueprint Health Demo Day</a> and as usual, we spent most of the car ride discussing VC and the startup ecosystem.  Every time I travel with Daniel, he knocks me over the head with some amazing story about the rich history of the VC community.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s moment was regarding the origin of the limited partnership in VC. Essentially, a limited partnership was supposed first used by Bill Elfers when he left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Research_and_Development_Corporation">American Research and Development Corporation</a> (widely regarded as one of the first VC firms and an investor in Digital Equipment Corporation) to found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylock_Partners">Greylock Partners</a> in 1965. The limited partnership was <a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/svhistory/sv/chap78.html">supposedly something Elfers had seen</a> during his days in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcatter">oil wildcatting business</a>.</p>
<p>Stories like these may not fundamentally change my outlook on limited partnerships or their use in VC, but they provide color and richness to many aspects of a business that are taken for granted. What&#8217;s particularly interesting about these sorts of stories is that much of the startup ecosystem is so focused on the present and the future, rather than the past.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this is, but as a whole I think we need to spend more time making sense of and honoring the history of our community.  Real-time data feeds and the next big thing are great, but there&#8217;s so much that entrepreneurs, VCs, and even users can understand and learn from those that have come before us.  I love seeing startups like <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> that are focused on collecting and organizing this historical data. Whether it&#8217;s through design approach, focus on historical data, or just through decision-making, I really hope we&#8217;ll see more startups show reverence to past.</p>
