<p>One of the longstanding jokes in business school is that MBAs think in PowerPoint. In the startup world, people don&#8217;t often think in PowerPoint - they think in code.  So what&#8217;s the easiest way to bridge that gap?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try and be something you&#8217;re not (unless you actually want to learn how to code). Instead, use the skills you have/are good at and put them to good use. Think you&#8217;ve got a great idea for a product but can&#8217;t build it with code? Build it with PowerPoint or Keynote.</p>
<p>Clickable prototypes save a ton of time in the design process and you can get your ideas in front of people quickly to test whether or not they&#8217;re valid. Keynote works on iPads too, so if you&#8217;re looking to build a mobile app, you can do it in Keynote AND test it on iPads with real users.  I&#8217;ve been doing this lately and I love it.</p>
<p>No more excuses. <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/post/29701849789/the-end-product-and-a-core-part-of-shelbys" target="_blank">JFBI</a>, even if it is in Keynote.</p>
