<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557006/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1937557006&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chriskurdziel-20">Designing for Emotion</a>, which contains a number of interesting examples about how design can be used to evoke emotion. <span>There are a few cool examples in the book, but the one that stood out to me most was Apple&#8217;s implementation of their blinking sleep status indicator. This has been documented before (</span><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6658577.html">and patented back in 2002</a><span>), but if anyone has wondered why their Macbook&#8217;s sleep indicator was strangely comforting it&#8217;s because the pulsating rhythm is based on the respiratory rate of a human (12-20 cycles per minute).</span></p>
<p><span>At Shelby, one of our core values is "</span><em><strong>be human</strong></em><span>" - this applies in the way we carry ourselves in the larger startup community, internally with our team and also in the way we approach building product.  This is a product philosophy that I&#8217;m increasingly taking to heart and one that I think has to be at the center of transformative technology products in slower-moving, low-tech industries.  </span></p>
<p><span>Take healthcare, for example. There are a ton of technology companies building solutions for the healthcare enterprise (I used to work at <a href="http://www.mckesson.com">one</a>), but most are just focused on performing a specific task and not providing enjoyable UX. As Aaron Walter says in </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557006/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1937557006&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chriskurdziel-20">Designing for Emotion</a><span>, &#8220;certainly we all want to eat edible foods with nutritional value, but we also crave <em>flavor</em>." Based on my experience, design of healthcare IT systems has been focused on making products that are &#8220;edible" - they get the job done but they&#8217;re pretty crappy in terms of creating an experience that physicians feel they can&#8217;t live without.  It&#8217;s no surprise to see that adoption of healthcare tech <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/electronic-medical-records/ehr-adoption-us-remains-the-slow-poke/240142152">is slow</a>. I believe there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for better, more human design to help speed the adoption of healthcare tech among a physician population that is short on time and patience.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone else have other examples of industries waiting to be transformed by designing with emotion?</span></p>
