title: The oral history of Silicon Valley VCs
---
A [friend of mine](http://twitter.com/zdanielshi) recently discovered [this archive](http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/vc/transcripts.html) of interview transcripts of many of Silicon Valley’s seminal venture capitalists.

Considering most of the guys on this list started their respective firms before the widespread adoption of the internet, I think it’s pretty cool to think about how this stuff was documented. In many cases, some of the details are much more intimate as a result of being recounted in a more informal fashion.

Don Valentine (founder of Sequoia Capital) doesn’t keep a blog or have a Facebook page, but he did sit down and [orally recount much of his history](http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/valentine_donald.pdf), which is documented in these archives.  It’s a fascinating read (both from a personal and a professional perspective) if you have the time to look through some of it.

Here’s a fun excerpt from his interview:

> Valentine: I don’t believe in business school.
>
> Hughes: Why?
>
> Valentine: We have people here at Sequoia who went to business school, but most of the primary partners here have not gone to business school. Or said differently, and this is a true story, when asked where I went to business school, I said, “Fairchild Semiconductor.” And the people said, “We’ve never heard of it.” I was talking to people who thought that if you didn’t go to Harvard Business School you could never learn how to manage money. And my rejoinder was I was not interested in learning how to raise money; I was interested in building great companies, and I didn’t have to go Harvard Business School to build great companies.
