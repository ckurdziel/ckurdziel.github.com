title: 'Minimum Viable Design'
---
Lots of startups (especially those in NYC) spend a ton of time on visual design and making sure that the look and feel of their product is close to perfect.

While my obsessive tendencies often encourage me to consider every design option presented, I’ve had to remember that too much attention to design can often get in the way of moving a product forward.

If you’re a startup trying to iterate quickly, understand your customer base and think about things as an MVP, there are times when it’s smart to eschew design for shipping product (provided it doesn’t cripple functionality). That extra bit of design/attention to detail can be helpful, for sure, but a good product person should understand when that matters and when it doesn’t.
