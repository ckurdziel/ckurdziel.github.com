Roblox is a supremely interesting company. I think their impending direct listing is going to be one to watch. After the Roblox S-1 came out in the fall, I did some analysis of it and the company alongside [Mario](https://twitter.com/mariodgabriele) at [The Generalist](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/) and a few others. It was a lot of fun - we'll probably talk more about this publicly as the direct listing draws nearer, but if you are interested in reading it, [you can find it here](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/roblox-ipo).
