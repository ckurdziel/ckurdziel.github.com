title: Interesting Healthcare IT Companies
---

I've never been much of a fan of fantasy sports as I've always felt business was more interesting than sports. To my knowledge, there isn't a place for "fantasy investing" so I thought I'd make a little list of companies I'd be investing in or interested in investing in if I was an active investor. If anyone has some cash they'd like to lend (and the founders of these companies need a few extra bucks), go for it. :)

Here are a list of companies I'd be investing in if I was a healthcare VC:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.eligibleapi.com/"><b>Eligible API</b></a> - Anyone who's spent time in healthcare IT industry knows that HL-7 is a huge issue for many healthcare providers. Eligible API is turning HL-7 data into. I don't see anyone else doing stuff like this on the healthcare infrastructure level and I think they're going to be huge.</li>
		<li><a href="http://ginger.io/"><b>ginger.io</b></a> - I've been enamored with ginger.io since I saw them demo at TechStars Boston a few years ago.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.flatiron.com/"><b>Flatiron Health</b></a> - The Flatiron team is working on a really complex problem - providing actionable clinical and business data to cancer care providers. Not all cancers are the same, and we're wasting a lot of money and energy on treating them, so having a solution that connects clinical decisionmaking with financial impact makes total sense. Really fantastic team and awesome use of technology.</li>
	</ul>

	Here's a list of industries I'd be investing in if I was a VC:
			<ul>
				<li>smart things (internet of things)</li>
				<li>healthcare</li>
				<li>video</li>
				<li>security</li>
				<li>data portablity & openness </li>
