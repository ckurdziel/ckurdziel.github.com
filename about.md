Hi, I'm Chris. I'm currently on a [vision quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbccrO8qKog) in search of what's next for me.

For the past year and a half, I managed new product development for Samsung’s NYC R&D lab where I worked with internal product leaders and external content partners to re-imagine Samsung’s TV platform and SDK.

Previously, I built [Shelby.tv](http://shelby.tv) (TechStars NY '11) with some great people. Our team was acquired by Samsung in 2014 to help build the future of TV.

I've been fortunate to learn from some great people along the way, and went to school at [Vanderbilt](http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/) and [Cornell](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/). I also used to do some [investing](http://www.brventurefund.com/) and worked in [healthcare](http://www.mckesson.com/) for a few years.

I'm a native New Yorker, have lived in 6 states and been to all 50. I'm also a gamer, golfer, guitarist and geek. I love memes, mountains, metal, music, and all sorts of the mayhem associated with this crazy city. But I obviously don't love alliteration.
