Hi, I'm Chris. I am currently focused on investing and building in consumer/creator facing web3 products. I live in the NYC area, but am also at home on the internet.

As an investor, I have led investments in gaming, crypto and creative technology at places like [Mirana Ventures](https://www.mirana.xyz/), [Samsung NEXT Ventures][0], [Joyance Partners][1] & [SocialStarts](http://socialstarts.com). You can read more about some of the companies I have invested in and worked with [here][8].

Before I became an investor, I worked to help video creators monetize and distribute their video online at [Vimeo][2] & VHX.tv (acquired by Vimeo). Before that, I worked with the R&D team at Samsung and some the world's best content partners to re-imagine Samsung’s smart TV platform. My startup origins date back to 2011, when I moved to New York to build [Shelby.tv][3] (TechStars NY '11) with some talented people. Our team was acquired by Samsung in 2014 to help build the future of TV.

I don't like writing about myself in the third person, but if you need a formal bio of me, you can [find it here](/bio/).

## Interests

I grew up on the internet and through it I discovered P2P technology, gaming, my favorite music, some of my best friends, and more. As I have grown older, I have traced my love of learning and technology back to a belief that access to these free, open networks and communities I found via the internet was instrumental in my own personal growth.

I am excited by technologies like Bitcoin, crypto networks and P2P networks. As infrastructure for these new decentralized technologies matures, I think we'll see a shift in how many of the huge networks on the web are structured, governed, and owned. Coupled with 3D game engines and other creative application-layer technology, I think we're going to see an explosion in the creative potential of the world.

Steve Jobs is famously attributed to the quote [“a computer is the equivalent of a bicycle for the mind.”][9] I love this quote and it gets to another reason I love technology - the best technology enhances and deepens the human experience instead of detracting from it. The last 10 years of technology development put an emphasis on growing abstract KPIs more than thoughtfully integrating technology into human lives.

Modern software development is amazing and enabled by a host of developer friendly tools and technologies, many of them open source. As these tools mature even further I expect that each of us will want to write software that goes to work for us.

I am excited about [rewilding the internet](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/) to a place that respects individuality, creativity and fosters tight knit human connection.
