Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a product guy who works at Samsung in NYC. Before that, I built [Shelby.tv](http://shelby.tv) with some great people.

I've been fortunate to learn from some great people along the way, and went to school at [Vanderbilt](http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/) and [Cornell](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/). I also used to do some [investing](http://www.brventurefund.com/) and worked in [healthcare](http://www.mckesson.com/) for a few years.

I'm a native New Yorker, have lived in 6 states and been to all 50. I'm also a gamer, golfer, guitarist and geek. I love memes, mountains, metal, music, and mayhem. But not alliteration.
