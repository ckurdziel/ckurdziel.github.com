My name is Chris. I went to school at [Vandy](http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/) and [Cornell](http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/). I used to do some [investing](http://www.brventurefund.com/) and worked in [healthcare](http://www.mckesson.com/) for a few years.

I was born in New York but I've lived in 6 states. I'm also a gourmand, gamer, golfer, and geek. I love memes, mountains, metal, music, and mayhem. And alliteration.

Now, I work at [Shelby.tv](http://shelby.tv). I also spend a lot of time thinking about problems in the healthcare industry.
