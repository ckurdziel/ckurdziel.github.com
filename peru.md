### Lima
  - We ate at a Ceviche place called El Mercado (in the Miraflores district). Amazing – make a reservation ahead of time for lunch because it’s crowded.
  - We stayed at a Sheraton Four Points in the Miraflores district using SPG points – we were only there for one night. Perfectly nice hotel, pretty walkable district as well. Miraflores is definitely the nice/safe place to stay, so whatever you pick should be in that area and you can walk to the cliffs overlooking the ocean from there too.

### Cusco restaurants/stuff to do:
  - Chicha (cool fancier peruvian dinner place)
  - Cicciolina (also good nice dinner place in Cusco)
  - Greens (good lunch place)
  - Bodega 138 (good pizza & beer place in Cusco)
  - Tons of churches/ruins - you can easily spend a day or two walking around Cusco, though it's a harder than it sounds because of the altitude.

### Urubamba/Ollantaytambo/Sacred Valley restuarants/stuff to do:
  - Huacantay in Urubamba - had a great dinner here - got the gnocchi with fresh veggies, chicken and chorizo. it was massive and delicious.
  - Kaia in Urubamba - small mostly veggie oriented place - really good lunch/dinner
  - Monestario - a pottery place in Urubamba - really cool gifts/stuff to take back for your apartment.
  - Sacred Valley Brewing Company - impossible to find (it's near Pachar in between Urubamba and Ollantaytambo so it needs a cab) but really good craft brewery started by some dudes who trained in Oregon.
  - In Ollantaytambo, definitely see the ruins. We also had lunch at a place which was pretty good called Hearts Café.
  - Tons more ruins in the Sacred Valley. We did Moray, Ollantaytambo, Sachsayhuaman, Pisaqa, and a few others. They’re all really cool.
  - Pisac is another cool town in the SV – they have a market on Sunday that is worth going to if you can (local food, etc).

### Machu Picchu/Aguas Calientes
  - We stayed in a hostel the last night of our trek which was perfectly fine/clean. Lots of decent hostels there I think.
  - No standout restaurants but lots of beer and places to hang out (we hung out at a place called Machu Pisco) - town has a trekking heavy vibe since most of the people that stay there are trekkers (the rich tourists come in/out on the train).
  - You can easily spend an entire day walking around Machu Picchu - make sure you have enough time there because it can be in the clouds for  a lot of the day
