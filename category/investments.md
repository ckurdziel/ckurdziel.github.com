As an investor, I've been fortunate to invest in and work with companies that include [Medal.tv](https://medal.tv/), [Statespace](https://statespace.gg/), [Eternal](https://eternal.plus/), [Forte](https://www.forte.io/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/), [Supermedium](http://supermedium.com/), [Dapper Labs](https://www.dapperlabs.com/), and [PlayVS](https://www.playvs.com/).

I'm excited to invest in founders that have a very strong view on the world they want to live in, are insatiably curious, and approach building a company with a user-first perspective. Often, these founders are people who are technical enough or scrappy enough to build their first prototype themselves and self-aware about where their shortcomings lie (and how to build the right team around them).

 When I work with founders, I try to be helpful mostly around product strategy & go-to-market, organizational/product growth, and fundraising. You can read more about that [here](/workwithme/).
