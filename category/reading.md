Though I've learned a lot through experience, I'm inspired by those that have paved the way. Here's a list of some reading and resources that I have found helpful (including a few things I’ve written to answer common questions I get).

### For product managers and aspiring product managers
- I keep a list of product management templates that include things like product requirements docs, sample user stories and more on Github. [Check them out here][1].

Here is some of my favorite reading about building products:
 - [Product Strategy Means Saying No][2]
 - [The pyramid model & what it means for PM focus][3]
 - [What Is A Product Manager? A Primer For Aspiring Or Junior PMs][4]
 - [We are Product Managers][5]
 - [42 Rules to Lead by from the Man Who Defined Google's Product Strategy][6]
 - [A Product Manager's Job][7]
 - [Be a great product leader][8]
 - [Good Product Manager, Bad Product Manager][9]
 - [How to hire a product manager][10]
 - [What distinguishes the top 1% of product managers from the top 10%][11]
 - [48 Articles and Books that will Make you a Great Product Manager][12]
 - [20 Product Prioritization Techniques][13]
- [How to Find, Vet and Close the Best Product Managers][14]

### For investors & founders
- I keep a list of my investment memo templates and other pieces I use in the process of making investments on Github. [You can check them out here][15].
- Steve Schlafman maintains a [great library of founder-related documents here](http://www.founderslibrary.org).
- Gunderson Dettmer's [legal doc library](https://www.docracy.com/doc/showalluserdocs?page=1&userId=80#) is quite useful.
- [The Holloway Guide to Equity Compensation](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation) is essential for any employee or founder thinking about their equity compensation.

### For those who are interested in how I consume information
I use Instapaper and Feedbin (both consumed via Reeder on iOS) to source interesting reading from all over the web. My system is relatively straightforward and requires only one app for consumption while pulling info from a variety of newsletters and online sources of interest. I’ll probably write more about how I consume information at a later date, or maybe even publish my OPML here if people are interested in learning more.

I keep track of what I read using [GoodReads][22]. One of my favorite books is [Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson][18].
