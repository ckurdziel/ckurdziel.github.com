I've been fortunate enough to travel a bunch over the course of my life. I started out by visiting all 50 US states, but recently Iâ€™ve been focused on traveling internationally.

For each trip I take, I compile suggestions/itineraries from friends who have been there. They're all up on my website/GitHub so you can add your own suggestions to the list.

Here are a few places I've been.
 - I've been to all 50 US states.
 - [Canada: Banff, Jasper & Yoho National Parks][2]
 - [Chile: San Pedro de Atacama][3]
 - [Chilean Patagonia: Torres del Paine][4]
 - [Peru: Lima, The Sacred Valley & trek to Machu Picchu][5]
 - [Iceland: Drive the Ring Road][6]
 - [Italy: Lake Como, Venice & The Dolomites][7]
 - [Amsterdam & The Netherlands][8]
 - Jackson Hole, WY, Grand Teton & Yellowstone National Parks

A few places I'd like to go:

 - Nepal
 - Greenland
 - South Africa
 - Antarctica
 - Svalbard, Norway
