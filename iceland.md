### Reykjavik
  - [Hotel Kvosin](http://kvosinhotel.is/): super cool apartment style hotels with a mini fridge/kitchen. Very new/clean and in the center of Rekjavik.
  - Hallgrímskirkja church. Super cool architecture. If you want pictures, get there early in the day and you'll have it all to yourself.
  - Harpa Concert Hall: beautiful architecture. Walk inside - there are also tours and a restaurant inside.
<!--   - MUSEUM: THE CULTURE HOUSE : Hverfisgata 15, Reykjavik -->
  - [Icelandic Penis Museum](http://phallus.is/en/): This exists and is hilarious/bizarre. It's a quick trip but pretty interesting.

  - Reykjavik Art Museum - there are three of these scattered across the city. One ticket gets you into all three on the same day. Really nice to walk the city and see the art!

  - Mokka for Coffee - good coffee, particular the Mocha, they use legit chocolate, also their breakfast menu is off the chain. try the big slice of toast with marmalade and cheese. it's a strange icelandic breakfast thing, delicious.

  - Tapas Barinn for dinner!

  - Saegreifinn - The Sea Baron -- super legit, super delicious, make sure you try the bisque, you can't really go wrong with anything. *We didn't go - but friends have been*

  - Noodle Station - Ramen - they load it up with toppings, and it's like the cheapest bowl of food you can get. it's quite good and open late

  - "Icelandic Fish and Chips" - freshest fish and chips you'll ever eat. lots of dipping sauces to pick from. good hearty fries! def goes down well with beer.

### Golden Circle & Surrounding Area

- Gullfoss - Big waterfall!

- Geysir - A natural geysir that shoots water from the ground every 10 mins

- Bruarfoss waterfall - Awesome looking waterfall with electric blue water that may

- Laugarvatn Fontana Natural steam rooms and geothermal baths. $25 entry

- Pingvellir (“Thingvellir”) Continental plates of Europe and America meet here

- Hike Reykjadalur (45mins) and find some hot pools to swim in – one of the few/ may not be technically open to the public. Many blog posts on how to get here http://www.fontana.is/en/openinghoursandservices (likely skip this given other geothermal baths) unmanaged hotsprings, you can swim wherever you want. Find where the hot water meets the cold water, this is the best temperature

- UNESCO Þingvellir National Park - See Northern Lights. On the way back to Reykjavik

## Day Trip Aside from Golden Circle

- Háifoss Waterfall

- Hekla Volcano - spent some time 4-wheeling off road trying to get near Hekla & Landmannalaugar. Tough to get to, so maybe take a guide or an even bigger 4WD (capable of crossing rivers).

- Landmannalaugar - hard to get to but apparently beautiful. We got 90% of the way there before turning back. :(

### Between Reykjavik & Vik

 - Hotel: Frost n Fire, [Thorsmork Volcano Huts (didn't go but would love to)](Thorsmork Volcanco Huts: http://www.volcanohuts.com/check-availability/)
- Reynisdrangar - giant rock structures in the ocean, and very cool natural perfect cubic rock formations in the cliff side near Vik

- Reynisfjara: Black sand beach near Vik with some crazy geometric cliffs and big jagged rock formations offshore

- Seljalandsfoss: A beautiful waterfall that you can see from the ring road but is actually a 100 metres off the ring road. It's possible to walk around the waterfall

- Skogafoss Waterfall Right next to Seljalandsfoss

- Thórsmörk

    - Good long hike: Fimmvörðuháls Pass from Thorsmork to Skógafoss

- Sólheimasandur Beaches w/ abandoned plane - between Skógafoss waterfall and the town of Vik. After driving past Skógafoss going East on Route 1, you’ll cross a bridge with blinking yellow lights and a dirt access road to Sólheimajökull Glacier on the left. The road sign here [PHOTO #1] marks the glacier access road. From this point, keep driving East for about 2 kilometers and keep your eyes open for another dirt road turnoff with a gate on your right [PHOTO #2]. It should be the only opening in the fence after the bridge. If you end up driving over a 2nd bridge, you’ve gone too far.

### Between Vik & Hofn

 - Fjadrargljufur Canyon: short hike and really scenic canyon. About a 20 minute detour off highway 1 on the way to Skaftafell from Vik.
 - Skaftafell National Park (and Islands)
 - Glacier walk – Skaftafell (http://www.glacierguides.is/equipment-list)
 - Eldhraun Lava Field in Skftafell park
 - Svartifoss waterfall (or the black waterfall) - easy to get to off of highway 1 (approx 200 meters away). Can walk behind whole waterfall. (Right near glacier walk/park entrance for Skaftafell)
  - Food: Gas station right outside Skaftafell has tasty burgers. Just trust me on this one.
 - Vatnajökull National Park (Vatnajokulsthjodgardur)
 - Jokulsaron Glacier lagoon - THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST. Incredibly goregous. Come back again if you don't see the icebergs floating out to sea.
 - [Fosshotel Vatnajokull](http://www.fosshotel.is/hotels/fosshotel-in-the-south-east/fosshotel-vatnajokull/): newly renovated. Funky service but great location if you're going to explore Vatnajokull area. Close to Hofn



### Akureyri & North (Diamond Circle)

- Dettifoss: Massive waterfall. Where the beginning of Prometheus was filmed. Be prepared for cold, wind, and snow. But it's awesome.
- Hverir Thermal Fields
- [Myvatn Baths](http://www.myvatnnaturebaths.is/en/lagoon): Better than the Blue Lagoon, even on a cold day.
- Dimmuborgir: Right next to Mývatn, Dimmuborgir is an area filled with dramatic rock formations and caves and often referred to as a gateway to Hell.
- Dinner: Vogafjos Cowshed Cafe in Myvatn.
- Goðafoss Falls at sunset is beautiful
- In Akureyri: [Akureyrarkirkja](www.akirkja.is): (A landmark church)

### More Stuff: Maybe next time?

 - Thrihnukagigur - volcano you can go inside of. Also sort of looks like a tourist trap.

 - Crystal Caves at Vatnajökull: in the winter you can go caving in the glacier. Sounds and looks beautiful, but dangerous in the summer months.

 - [UNESCO Site: Surtsey Island](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1267)
