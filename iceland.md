        - MUSEUM: THE CULTURE HOUSE : Hverfisgata 15, Reykjavik

        - Penis Museum

    - Reykjavik Art Museum - Awesome according to Matyus
    - Mokka for Coffee - good coffee, particular the Mocha, they use legit chocolate, also their breakfast menu is off the chain. try the big slice of toast with marmalade and cheese. it's a strange icelandic breakfast thing, delicious.

    - Tapas Barinn for dinner!

    - Saegreifinn - The Sea Baron -- super legit, super delicious, make sure you try the bisque, you can't really go wrong with anything

    - Noodle Station - Ramen - they load it up with toppings, and it's like the cheapest bowl of food you can get. it's quite good and open late

    - "Icelandic Fish and Chips" - freshest fish and chips you'll ever eat. lots of dipping sauces to pick from. good hearty fries! def goes down well with beer.

    - I haven't been, but, when margo was living there, she went to this really nice/fancy Indian food restaurant, I'll ask her what it's called, she said it was amazing.

- Hike Reykjadalur (45mins) and find some hot pools to swim in – one of the few/ may not be technically open to the public.

- Skogafoss Waterfall Right next to Seljalandsfoss

- Thórsmörk

    - Good long hike: Fimmvörðuháls Pass from Thorsmork to Skógafoss

- Sólheimasandur Beaches w/ abandoned plane - between Skógafoss waterfall and the town of Vik. After driving past Skógafoss going East on Route 1, you’ll cross a bridge with blinking yellow lights and a dirt access road to Sólheimajökull Glacier on the left. The road sign here [PHOTO #1] marks the glacier access road. From this point, keep driving East for about 2 kilometers and keep your eyes open for another dirt road turnoff with a gate on your right [PHOTO #2]. It should be the only opening in the fence after the bridge. If you end up driving over a 2nd bridge, you’ve gone too far.
