## Roadmaps & Prioritization
Setting and executing on a roadmap is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of being a product manager. Here’s how I approach the act of road mapping.

## What to solve for when creating a roadmap:
**Look 3-6 months out.** Looking any farther out can be really tough given the nature of the way things change in the technology world. That said, you’ll still want to have a strategy in place for how you’re thinking about the 6+ month period (but know that the actual roadmap items that execute on that strategy could change significantly). 
 
**Involve the team in the process.** Roadmapping is a great opportunity to involve the rest of the team in helping shape the “future” of the business. Make no mistake - I’m not advocating for a totally democratic or “by committee” process, but I do think that structuring road mapping exercises for the team can be a useful way to solicit input and make sure that everyone feels “heard.” It’s also a great way to get the team excited and thinking about bigger problems. Get the team’s input on possibilities for the roadmap, and leverage their technical expertise when weighing the effort and impact of different roadmap items.
