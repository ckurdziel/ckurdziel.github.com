      <p><span>Ever since I was a kid, I spent hours clicking around on computers, obsessed with learning the ins and outs of whatever OS, application, or web product I discovered at the time. I remember when I got my first Windows laptop after years of using a Mac, I explored every little system setting and tweaked ini files so I could get an experience that was exactly what I wanted. Over time, this obsession with technology guided me to study CS in college and subsequently work in tech.</span></p>
<p>Though I have experience interacting with consumers (at <a href="http://shelby.tv">Shelby</a>) and businesses (at <a href="http://mckesson.com">McKesson</a>) using vastly different kinds of tech products, I have relatively modest training (other than my hands-on experience) on the fundamentals that inform great product design and the process required to effectively manage larger product teams.  In my effort to become more well-versed in the history and community of the product, I thought I&#8217;d start a weekly post on product to share my findings with the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus begins Product Thursdays. If there&#8217;s stuff you&#8217;d love to see, drop me an <a href="mailto:ckurdziel+product@gmail.com">email</a> with a suggestion!  Otherwise, here&#8217;s a list of where I&#8217;ll probably head with this:</p>
<ol><li><span><strong>Product Resources</strong> - What are some great sources for learning/self-study about product design?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Product Process</strong> - What companies are known for building awesome products and how do they do it?</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Product Examples</strong> - What are the best examples of products that I&#8217;m currently enjoying and why do I think they&#8217;re awesome? </span></li>

      <p>Last <a href="http://io9.com/what-was-it/" target="_blank">Thursday night</a> I had the incredible opportunity to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson" target="_blank">Neil DeGrasse Tyson</a> speak at the <a href="http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/" target="_blank">Hayden planetarium</a> here in New York about brining STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) to more people and making it a deeper part of our culture. The theme of the event was "<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5927637/first-comes-the-dream-at-the-american-museum-of-natural-history-an-evening-of-innovation-and-imagination" target="_blank">First Comes the Dream</a>." </p>
<p><br/><iframe frameborder="0" height="253" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cXzH5reZRHk" width="450"></iframe></p>
<p>One of my favorite comments of the night was when Neil remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"the extent to which entertainment reaches for the lowest mental acuity is an indication we are not reaching high enough."  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree completely.</p>
<p>Neil went on to advocate for pop culture as an effective tool to bring people into real education and I got to thinking about how this dovetails pretty nicely with some of our goals at Shelby.  </p>
<p>We strongly believe in the power of the internet to surface content that <em>does</em> reach high enough (in part because discovery driven by the user). While a video of a wolf playing with a bear might just be written off as cute to some, it can also act as inspiration for those that want to understand more than they see in the video. When such a video is presented in a collection of video about nature and science, it acts as an entry point that then engages the viewer in something more meaningful for the rest of their viewing session.  In addition, the experience of Internet video is not just about the content itself - it&#8217;s also about the community and discussion that happens around this video and engages people even more (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Though the team at <a href="http://shelby.tv" target="_blank">Shelby</a> is not (yet) building a spacecraft that will take us on manned missions to Mars, we are really focused on helping everyone (not just the tech enabled) find and engage with the video that tickles the brain more than the average bit of network TV.  I&#8217;m excited to keep after that vision with Reece and Dan and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the new Shelby unleashed upon the world.</p>
<p>For a full video of Neil&#8217;s talk, check out the embed at the top of this post. Thanks to the awesome crew at Brew PR and Gizmodo for helping put this event together!</p>

        Silicon Valley Doesn't Have to be Wall Street
      </a>
    </h2>
    <div class="post-meta">
  <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2012</span>
  <span class="post-categories">

      <p>The tech industry originally made its name by being different than Wall Street - it&#8217;s a place where people can make money but simultaneously eschew the conventions of dress code and corporatism in favor of something more grand &#8212; the chance to change an industry (or dare I say, even the world).</p>
<p>I recently read an <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/what-happened-to-silicon-values/258905/">article about how Silicon Valley has betrayed some of the traditional values that made it great</a>. In the article, Bill Davidow argues, &#8220;the valley is no longer as concerned about serving the customer, and even sees great opportunity in exploitation. We are beginning to act like the bankers who sold subprime mortgages to naïve consumers. In such an environment, we are less likely to create the role models of the past who guided the valley to its future."</p>
<p><img align="right" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7bicwi4ZG1qaedq5.jpg"/>This is a pretty controversial statement, but Davidow makes a good point. He goes on to say that &#8220;Lock-in creates dominant players &#8212; witness Google, Facebook, Microsoft. And in this monopoly-driven environment, customers get exploited." That somewhat true [but overly simplistic] analysis is certainly consistent with sentiment toward Wall Street. Two recent examples of Wall Street&#8217;s attitude towards customers come to mind: the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=libor+scandal&amp;oq=libor+scandal">Libor scandal</a>, and the recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/business/goldman-sachs-and-a-sale-gone-horribly-awry.html?_r=2&amp;hpw&amp;pagewanted=all">lawsuit involving Goldman Sachs and Dragon software</a>. In both cases, bankers are characterized with attitudes of putting their own interests (growth, getting paid, etc.) ahead of those of their customers. &#8220;We guided them to a completed transaction" at first seems like bankers are doing their jobs (technically, they are), but such a mindset is one of the reasons we equate Wall Street banks with "<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405">blood sucking vampire squids</a>."</p>
<p>Quick pivots, data driven decision-making, and Facebook&#8217;s Open Graph can open a world of possibilities among startups. I&#8217;d argue that such tools aren&#8217;t inherently good or evil &#8212; they exist to be used however companies choose to use them. However, the communities we develop with these tools do often end up with a conscience. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit&#8217;s</a> community almost certainly made it a longer term success than <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>. Even though it wasn&#8217;t a giant financial outcome, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> avoided the issues of <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> (overly rapid growth without proper community) by focusing on the long term and only employing tools for growth when they were right for their community/customers. <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian">Alexis</a> and Steve were comfortable with an exit that allowed them to keep building and preserved the longer term vision of what Reddit was about. In the end, they&#8217;re the ones bigger than ever, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/12/digg-sold-to-linkedin-and-the-washington-post-and-betaworks/">Digg just got sold in a firesale</a>.</p>
<p>Take Facebook&#8217;s Open Graph: <a href="http://socialcam.com/">Socialcam</a> was able to leverage the open graph to snatch the #1 Facebook application spot in just a few short months. Traffic has supposedly plateaued recently and some even indicate that <a href="http://appdata.com/apps/facebook/150768931647055-socialcam">usage of the app is down</a>. Today, news hit the wire that <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120717/autodesk-buys-mobile-video-shooting-star-socialcam-for-60m/">Socialcam sold for $60M to Autocad</a>. While this outcome appears to be tremendous for the founders and early investors in Socialcam (congrats to all of them), many will infer that this exit was almost entirely predicated on the large user base Socialcam was able to attract using the Open Graph. A number of founders will now to look to Open Graph not as a way to connect with the *right* users in a way that is meaningful, but rather as a tool that might help them flip their company for a big payday.</p>
<p><img align="left" height="150" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7bidbuVx01qaedq5.jpg" width="150"/>When too many high profile companies use tools like data, the Open Graph, or others to extract value from customers at the expense of building lasting value, we cheapen the value proposition of the tech industry as a whole (especially relative to finance). Now, more than ever, it&#8217;s important for us to set the example in tech of how <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Responsible-Company-Yvon-Chouinard/dp/0980122783">companies can be responsible</a>.</p>
<p>As a VC, I can imagine it is difficult to balance the need to return your investors&#8217; capital in a relatively short timeframe with the fact that may be at odds with what is right for the business in the long term. Similarly, as a founder, it&#8217;s probably easy to go for use number growth at the expense of real community/engagement to generate hype and valuation bumps faster than the competition.<strong> Sure, it may net you a quick exit and create an illusion of value, but it&#8217;s not something that benefits people outside the tech ecosystem in the long term. </strong><strong>Isn&#8217;t that why so many of us &#8220;dreamers and doers" are here to begin with?</strong></p>

      <p>A <a href="http://twitter.com/zdanielshi">friend of mine</a> recently discovered <a href="http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/vc/transcripts.html">this archive</a> of interview transcripts of many of Silicon Valley&#8217;s seminal venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Considering most of the guys on this list started their respective firms before the widespread adoption of the internet, I think it&#8217;s pretty cool to think about how this stuff was documented. In many cases, some of the details are much more intimate as a result of being recounted in a more informal fashion.  </p>
<p>Don Valentine (founder of Sequoia Capital) doesn&#8217;t keep a blog or have a Facebook page, but he did sit down and <a href="http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/roho/ucb/text/valentine_donald.pdf">orally recount much of his history</a>, which is documented in these archives.  It&#8217;s a fascinating read (both from a personal and a professional perspective) if you have the time to look through some of it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a fun excerpt from his interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valentine: I don’t believe in business school.</p>
<p>Hughes: Why?</p>
<p>Valentine: We have people here at Sequoia who went to business school, but most of the primary partners here have not gone to business school. Or said differently, and this is a true story, when asked where I went to business school, I said, “Fairchild Semiconductor.” And the people said, “We’ve never heard of it.” I was talking to people who thought that if you didn’t go to Harvard Business School you could never learn how to manage money. And my rejoinder was I was not interested in learning how to raise money; I was interested in building great companies, and I didn’t have to go Harvard Business School to build great companies.</p>

      <p><p class="p1"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2cis49k7f1qaedq5.jpg"/></p>
<p class="p1">A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://blueprinthealth.org">Blueprint Health</a>&#8217;s inaugural demo day here in New York.  For the unititiated, <a href="http://blueprinthealth.org">Blueprint</a> is an accelerator and member of the Techstars network specifically focused on healthcare startups. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sladenyc">Mat</a> and Brad are great guys and really invested in the success of Blueprint and the <a href="http://www.blueprinthealth.org/index.php?page=companies">companies</a> they mentor.  Healthcare startups outside of the quantified self movement haven&#8217;t really been in the limelight (as far as I can tell) so I was blown away away when I got to the Blueprint offices and was greeted by a packed house and tons of investors that traditionally focus on the consumer internet space.</p>
<p class="p1">I have a feeling we&#8217;re only seeing the beginning of innovation within healthcare. There&#8217;s an incredible amount of opportunity in this space and I hope that the entrepreneurs who face this tough road are courageous enough to keep trudging along even in spite of the fact that it&#8217;s a difficult space to work in. The long sales cycles, physician adoption challenges and a host of other things are enough to frustrate someone who expects the pace of innovation in healthcare to mirror that of consumer web services.  In a world where super fast $1B sorts of outsized returns dominate headlines (oh hey Instagram!), it&#8217;s understandably a tough thing to stay focused on a business that might be a &#8220;grind" over the long haul.  In light of this recent news about Instagram, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about how the current consumer internet landscape can relate to other verticals (in addition to the impact it will have on them).</p>
<p class="p1">Dennis Crowley worked on Dodgeball and has been thinking about location for most of his career - he started thinking about this problem a while ago but it has only been recently (in the past few years) that he and his team have been able to really bring their solution to the masses. This example is one that is relevant to healthcare, I think. I hope we&#8217;ll see more young entrepreneurs take a crack at problems in healthcare and even if their first companies fail, they&#8217;ll keep working on effecting change in the space.  These are the entreprneuers I want to work with and I&#8217;m really excited that others like Brad and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sladenyc">Mat</a> at Blueprint Health have committed to working with them over the long haul as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Because of the nature of incumbents, regulation and other factors, it&#8217;s unclear whether or not we&#8217;ll see a Google or Facebook sized exit in the heathcare IT world.  However, I am hopeful that we&#8217;ll see a a number of companies have a big impact, help cut a ton of waste and save millions of lives in the process. I hope that there are a bunch of entrepreneurs willing to &#8220;go for it" and endure the pain of the process in the hopes of changing the industry.  And <strong>I hope that there are also investors out there who are willing to weather the storm and back the entrepreneurs who may be a bit idealistic now but who have the fresh perspective necessary to succeed in the face of the challenges we face in the long term. Their first idea may not be a huge hit, but the next few very well might.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em>PS - I realize it might seem hypocritical that I&#8217;m writing this post as someone working for a consumer Internet company. While that is a fair point, I&#8217;m still involved in healthcare on a number of fronts and I strongly believe that experience in a consumer oriented internet company coupled with my healthcare background can actually help me provide perspective in healthcare that is unique (hence this blog post). Right now, though, my skill set is best served with the greatest team in NYC building an awesome <a href="http://shelby.tv">product</a> that I love. :)</em></p></p>
