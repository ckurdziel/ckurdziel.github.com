      <p>It&#8217;s no secret that Cornell and Stanford are both gunning for NYC&#8217;s applied science and tech campus initiative. I&#8217;m obviously biased here, but <a href="http://www.observer.com/2011/11/cornells-the-one-when-it-comes-to-new-yorks-tech-campus/">I&#8217;m not the only one</a> who thinks there are a few pretty compelling reasons that Cornell would be the best choice for the city.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Cornell already has an active and engaged alumni base in NYC.</strong> We&#8217;ve got a <em>huge</em> network of alumni (including the <a href="http://www.cornellangels.com/">Cornell Angel Network</a>) who stay in New York after graduation. Scott Belsky <a href="http://scottbelsky.tumblr.com/post/11581276875/bringing-tech-talent-to-nyc-cornell">makes a great point</a> that a good portion of the existing Cornell network is already in New York and that the network effects of the existing alumni base will KEEP tech talent in NYC over the long term.  I agree.</li>
<li><strong>Incredible engineering talent and unique programs.</strong> MIT and Stanford get a lot of press for their kick-ass engineering programs.  Cornell gets less, but having spent a bunch of time in and around the engineering buildings on campus this fall, I have to say that I&#8217;m blown away by some of the talent here.  The biggest problem is that a lot of the engineering talent isn&#8217;t as aware of what&#8217;s going on in NYC - a campus in NYC would change that.  We&#8217;ve also got some non-traditional curricula like <a href="http://www.human.cornell.edu/fsad/">Fabric Science</a> and <a href="http://foodscience.cornell.edu/">Food Science</a> that I think embody the interesting conflux between technology and other industries (such fashion and food) that are part of the New York culture.  Top it off with extracurriculars like <a href="http://www.brventurefund.com">BR Venture Fund</a>, the business school&#8217;s small $1.5M seed stage venture fund (full disclosure: I&#8217;m one of the lucky MBAs that helps run this fund) and you&#8217;ve got a really unique set of complements to Cornell&#8217;s core engineering program that set it apart from the competition.</li>
<li><strong>We&#8217;re not already in NYC but are still close by.</strong> As I&#8217;ve been traveling back and forth between NYC and Ithaca, I&#8217;m slowly coming to the realization that each place has served a distinct purpose in my development over the past year.  This may seem a little counter-intuitive, but the fact that Cornell&#8217;s main campus is not in NYC is a <em>good</em> thing. Ithaca is a quiet (albeit brutally cold) safe haven from the bustle of the city.  I think there&#8217;s a real benefit to being able to learn in an environment that is solely focused on learning. I also think having a campus in NYC and in Ithaca gives students the opportunity to both focus on real world application of their learning (in NYC) and escape for some more introspective learning (in Ithaca).</li>
</ol><p>If you&#8217;re interested in more of Cornell&#8217;s propsal, check out the Cornell in NYC website <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/nyc/">here</a> and make sure to follow the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nyctechcampus">twitter account</a> for updates as well!  This is a really exciting time for the tech community in NYC and I&#8217;m really excited that Cornell has the opportunity to be a bigger part of it than it already is.  Whether we win the proposal or not, I have no doubt that our alumni will continue to make a dent in the NYC tech scene for years to come.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve had a few conversations with classmates, prospective MBAs and others looking to get into the startup world lately about making the transition from a big corporation to a small startup.  One of the common questions that comes up is &#8220;how did you sell your corporate experience to a startup?"</p>
<p>One of the underlying assumptions here is that corporate experience isn&#8217;t particularly valuable in the startup world, but I don&#8217;t think that could be farther from the truth.  Here&#8217;s a few reasons why your experience at a big company might actually make you more valuable to a startup:</p>
<ol><li><strong>You know how the incumbent works.</strong> If you&#8217;re looking to join a startup that is disrupting an industry you used to work in, you know what the existing challenges are in that industry.  Long sales cycle? Complicated barriers to entry? Excessive government regulation? User adoption issues? All this stuff is relevant to startups and your experience from the perspective of a big company can be really valuable to a startup.</li>
<li><strong>You know what an idea looks like at scale.</strong> While it&#8217;s certainly awesome to work for a startup because startups are agile, startups want to be successful. With that success comes scale, and if you&#8217;re someone that knows what works and what doesn&#8217;t at scale, you can add a ton of value. </li>
<li><strong>You might be the only one with corporate experience.</strong>  A lot of young tech entrepreneurs have been building businesses for their entire professional careers and thus may not have experience in a big company.  Guess what that means? You can think differently and that&#8217;s a GOOD thing.</li>
</ol><p>There are probably a bunch of items I&#8217;m missing here, but I think the real point is ultimately this:</p>
<p><em><strong>If you really want to work at a startup and identify with the product and the vision, your experience is only as relevant as you make it</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Any experience is better than no experience, so get out there and do stuff! Then figure out what makes you unique and sell that to the founders.  </p>
<p>What do you think about making the transition from a big company to a startup?  I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.</p>

      <p>I used to hate running.</p>
<p>About a week and a half ago (yeah, I know this post is late), I had the pleasure of running the 42nd ING NYC Marathon along with a few of my colleagues at <a href="http://shelby.tv">Shelby.tv</a> and a few classmates at Cornell.  Aside from the obvious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker.27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">numerical significance</a> of the event, my 26.2 mile journey gave me a chance to think about what the whole experience of training, fundraising and running has done for me personally.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ludjy87eB71qaedq5.jpg"/></p>
<p>Unlike a few of my <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/post/10733513796/ok-heres-episode-2-from-last-week-we-got-a">compadres</a> at Shelby, I&#8217;ve never considered myself much of an athlete. I didn&#8217;t have a time goal for the marathon - instead my focus was on running the entire 26.2 miles and making it across the finish line.</p>
<p>Looking back on the day, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful that my legs held out and that I was able to finish the race.  Though my time wasn&#8217;t the best, I&#8217;m definitely proud of the fact that my splits actually got faster during each subsequent mile.  Some more experienced marathoners have told me that this is a pretty tough thing to do, so I guess that means I did something right. As many who have run marathons will tell you, the last six miles are brutal (at any pace) and in that final stretch, I discovered I had more mental fortitude than I thought to <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/10/25/love-this-pic-as-someone-who-works-for-a-startup-and-is-running-the-marathon-lets-hope-i-finish-i-agreearainertwith-the-nyc-marathon-a-few-weeks-away-november-6th-people-make-sure-you-get-out-there-and.html">finish</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from the mental (and obvious physical) benefits of running a marathon, I was lucky enough to participate in the <a href="http://www.teamintraining.org/">Team in Training program</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="http://www.lls.org/">Leukemia and Lymphoma society</a>. My grandfather died from lymphoplasmactic lymphoma a few years ago and I wanted to honor his memory and support a cause that is dear to my heart.  There were definitely a few moments during the run on Sunday when I spent a lot of time reflecting on how lucky I am to be in good health and to be able to run such an amazing race.  Thanks to everyone - family, friends and others - who took the time to support me in raising money for this cause.  I can&#8217;t thank you enough - you helped <a href="http://pages.teamintraining.org/nyc/nyc11/bigred">our team become the top fundraising family &amp; friends team in the NYC chapter for Team in Training</a>!</p>
<p>Over the course of my run, I ran into a bunch of people I met in NY tech this summer, family, friends and a few thousand new faces as well. Much like my experience in NY tech, I&#8217;ve found that my level of success and happiness is really tightly coupled with the awesome people I surround myself with.  With that in mind, thanks to everyone in NYC for coming out and supporting all of the runners.  Never thought I&#8217;d say this&#8230;but&#8230;I don&#8217;t think this was my last marathon.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;m back in my second year at business school, I&#8217;m getting a few questions from classmates on how to go about getting an internship at a startup.  In a selfish attempt to not repeat myself too many times, I figured it might actually be a good idea to blog about this so I have things documented for eternity on the internets.</p>
<p>Though my internship this summer was really <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/05/23/what-im-doing-this-summer-and-why-the-heck-you-should-care.html">obtained via a pretty organic process</a>, I think there are a few common threads between my experience and the experiences of a number of other startup interns (both MBA and otherwise).  I&#8217;m no expert, but some of this stuff should help if you&#8217;re not sure where to start with applying for startup jobs (or your money back!).</p>
<ol><li><strong>Be authentic &amp; have an opinion.</strong> I&#8217;ve touched on this before in a <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/05/23/what-im-doing-this-summer-and-why-the-heck-you-should-care.html">previous post</a>, but just be yourself.  Cultural fit matters a TON if you&#8217;re going to land a startup internship or job, so that overly formal cover letter or &#8220;to whom it may concern" email is really going to alienate you in the eyes of most companies.  </li>
<li><strong>Instead of spending a ton of time on your resume, be active on social media.</strong>  <a href="http://www.marketing.fm/2010/10/04/why-write-a-blog-at-all/">As Brad Burnham says</a>, &#8220;You can work really hard on crafting a well written, organized, resume with bullet points of accomplishments – but you can’t fake 500 blog posts." Not much more that needs to be said about this one.</li>
<li><strong>Know the product.</strong>  I can&#8217;t stress this one enough.  Most early stage startups are almost exclusively product companies.  Chances are no matter what you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;ll be interacting with the product, so make sure you know it from top to bottom.  Know what you like and what you <em>don&#8217;t</em> like as well.  Both are equally valuable and will help you relate to the customers and users of  business.</li>
<li><strong>Know the market &amp; business model (or potential business model). </strong>This is important whether you&#8217;re in a technical role or a business role - if you are going to be a successful company, you&#8217;re going to have to figure out a way to generate revenue and get paid! If you&#8217;re a business guy (or gal) at a pre-revenue company, have ideas about this and an action plan of how to make some of them happen. If you want to work for a post-revenue company, make sure you understand the different ways revenue comes in the door and how you can help increase that revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Know the technology. </strong> As a business guy at a startup, it&#8217;s easy to just focus on the dollars and deals that need to get done, but if you don&#8217;t understand the basic technical challenges, you&#8217;re at a disadvantage.  Asking about technical aspects of the business ("what stack are you running on?") up front can be a great way to set yourself apart from other &#8220;MBA" style candidates and demonstrate the kind of holistic view that startups are looking for.  If founders can teach themselves how to code and build an MVP while surviving on ramen, you can take 30 minutes to understand what Node.js and Ruby on Rails are and how they&#8217;re important to a startup&#8217;s product.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t suck at email.</strong> This one is pretty underrated.  My experience at Shelby taught me to be much better about how I approach people via email (I&#8217;m still far from perfect).  Keep emails short and to the point (no more than a few sentences) and include something that&#8217;s personal in each one.  If you&#8217;re trying to get on someone&#8217;s calendar, propose a number of times that work and let them pick - they&#8217;ll suggest something if a time doesn&#8217;t work. Remember, the more you can illicit a response from the person you email, the better chance you&#8217;ll end up in their priority inbox when you email them down the road.</li>
<li><strong>Sell yourself.</strong> Startup internships (and jobs, by extension) are a totally different experience than a formal internship program at a large company.  You&#8217;ll be expected to hit the ground on day one and make things happen for your company.  As part of landing the job, you&#8217;ll probably have to sell how your skills can be useful to advance the state of the company during the time that you&#8217;ll be there.</li>
<li><strong>Get intros from VCs.</strong> VCs know their portfolio really well - if you know investors, you get intros to portfolio companies.  Guess what? If they are taking VC money, they&#8217;re probably thinking about hiring. Oh, you&#8217;re looking for a job?</li>
<li><strong>Expect nothing, earn everything.</strong> This is one of the mottos we really embrace at Shelby, and I&#8217;d say that going into an internship with this kind of attitude is a great way to get the most out of it.  Sure, you can worry about a paycheck, whether the internship &#8220;looks good on a resume" or what your <a href="http://twitter.com/internzero">title</a> is, but at the end of the day, your internship should be about growing personally and professionally and helping the company grow too.  Worry about that, and the rest will take care of itself.</li>
</ol><p>Alright, now that I&#8217;ve gotten that off my chest, go off and get some jobs! If you work hard and have a little luck on your side, hopefully other people will be saying <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGZ1nK4mOuw">this</a> about you.</p>

<p class="p1">As many of those who I&#8217;ve met in the NYC tech community may know, I&#8217;ve acquired the name intern zero (i[0], IZ or intern[0] for short) during my stint at Shelby.tv this summer. It&#8217;s a term of endearment (right guys?), and one that I&#8217;ll sorely miss.  Now that my summer is coming to close, it&#8217;s time for me to <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/post/9249744430/back-to-school-internzero">return to Cornell to continue to focus on my MBA</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Spending my <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/05/23/what-im-doing-this-summer-and-why-the-heck-you-should-care.html">summer with the Shelby.tv team</a> was an incredible experience, and exposed me to a ton of elements of early stage startups that I&#8217;d never seen before.  When next summer rolls around, I know the guys at Shelby.tv will still be firing on all cylinders, so they&#8217;ll probably be in need of some more interns.  While none of them will have the illustrious title of i[0], I&#8217;d like to offer some words about my experience to intern[1] and beyond.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Be ready to take ownership.</strong>  Though you will undoubtedly perform some &#8220;intern" tasks such as washing Dan&#8217;s feet, being Myles&#8217; wingman, and performing tricks for treats, most of your internship will be largely what you make of it.  Meet with anyone and everyone you can, and ask for help if you need it.  I&#8217;ve worked a corporate job for the past 4 years and it took me a while to get into the rhythm of planning my own day. Thankfully, I got to build my &#8220;dream" internship, and you will too. Just be ready for it.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a balanced attitude.</strong>  Startups are an emotional rollercoaster.  Days at Shelby are far more often good than bad, but any startup has an ebb and flow and when people aren&#8217;t &#8220;in the zone" it requires a team that is self aware enough to put things back on track.  I&#8217;m proud of have been part of a team that was able to do this really well and I hope that subsequent interns are able to help in a similar fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Get ready to work with some of the best people you&#8217;ve ever met.</strong>  This isn&#8217;t a job that you go to and then go home from. You&#8217;ll hang out on weekends, eat late night dinners together at the office, andhave some hilarious and crazy experiences together. I got to know the team pretty well this summer and they&#8217;re some of the best people I&#8217;ve met. The emotional experience of building something together (even as a non-engineer) is better than almost any feeling I&#8217;ve experienced, so give it 110% and immerse yourself. You&#8217;ll be glad you did.</li>
</ol><p class="p1">Though my formal summer internship with the Shelby.tv team is over, I&#8217;m still engaged in planning <strong><a href="http://nyc.hackday.tv">nyc.hackday.tv</a> (GO <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2072060589">SIGN UP</a> NOW!)</strong> and will be working with the team on odds and ends over the next few weeks.  </p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>To Reece, Dan, Myles &amp; Henry</strong></em> - thanks for giving me this awesome opportunity, pushing me to take ownership and make stuff happen for Shelby.  It&#8217;s been incredible to work with people that are so passionate, considerate and intelligent. You have set the standard for the kind of workplace environment I strive to be a part of.  See you in NYC very soon.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>To the New York Tech community, TechStars teams, and all those that I&#8217;ve met this summer</strong></em> - thank you for welcoming me into your world.  New York has an undeniable energy about it and I was really struck by the commitment that everyone here has to making this city a force to be reckoned with (congrats to the GroupMe guys for a step in that direction!).  I can&#8217;t wait to finish up school and get back to be part of building that with you all.</p></p>
