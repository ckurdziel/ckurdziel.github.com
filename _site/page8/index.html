<p>Anyone who has checked Twitter (or any tech new source) in the past 24 hours has heard the news about Google&#8217;s Eric Schmidt stepping aside as CEO.  I can&#8217;t speak for what those inside Google would say (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Eric-Schmidt">that&#8217;s what Quora is for</a>), but from the outside, it looks like this is a good thing for the company and probably even a little late.</p>
<p>Google seems to have lost their direction lately and have made more news for their <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/12/dishwashers_dem.html">increasingly irrelevant search results due to content farms</a> rather than the awesome products that drew people to them in the first place.  It&#8217;s good to see Larry back in charge of the company he helped build and I think it sends a strong message to Google employees that they might see a renewed focus on the things that made Google such a dynamic company in its early days.  It will be interesting to see whether Larry&#8217;s return as CEO will also help keep strong engineering talent from migrating to Facebook, Apple and others that pose a threat to Google. </p>
<p>Albert at USV has written <a href="http://continuations.com/post/2857077313/rooting-for-larry-and-the-internet">a nice post about what he hopes to see from Larry</a>, and I have to say that I hope for the same.  Google has an opportunity to remain an &#8220;equalizer" and advocate for openness on the Internet and in the mobile space (and, yes, still be hugely profitable).  While I love my iPhone, I think that a cloud space dominated by closed, proprietary technology (Apple, Facebook, etc.) is ultimately an unhealthy place for consumers and new innovation.  As Albert puts it, Google can &#8220;figure out how to succeed by making others succeed." Here&#8217;s to hoping.</p>

      <p>Back in 2006 or so when I first got my hands on Guitar Hero, I remember thinking that the game was one of the coolest and most innovative video games I had ever played.  Fast forward to 2010 and <a target="_blank" href="http://xboxfreedom.com/fender-squier-meet-the-ultimate-rock-band-3-controller/">Rock Band 3&#8217;s upcoming guitar controller</a> is continuing to push the envelope of the gaming landscape.  Aside from the awesome technology that is likely behind this thing, I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether the hyper-realistic new controller is breeding a generation of homogeneous guitarists that play the instrument with the same approach.</p>
<p>One of the most fun things about learning to play guitar for me was trying to figure out how to give my guitar a &#8220;voice" like I heard on many of my favorite albums.  Frankly, I&#8217;m <em>still </em>working on that.  So many of rock&#8217;s innovative guitarists (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix">Hendrix</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour">Gilmour</a>, etc.) relied on their ear to develop a sense of style.  With Guitar Hero, Rock Band, YouTube, and the plethora of tabs available on the internet, it&#8217;s easier than ever to learn how to play like your idols.  While that is a component of learning the instrument and developing one&#8217;s own voice, I think that overexposure to these channels can deprive one of the instinct and musical sense that are required to really master the instrument.  Just like blind people often develop stronger senses of hearing, musicians need to isolate themselves from their influences every so often in order to strengthen their own musical senses.</p>
<p>Games like Rock Band 3 can be great fun and a fantastic tool for generating interest in music.  But there&#8217;s no substitute for a real instrument and the work, creativity, and practice that come along with giving it your own voice.</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>
<p> The four of us arrived in the Exum Mountain Guides parking lot to meet up with our guides: <a href="http://www.exumguides.com/?page_id=173">Lynne Wolfe</a>, <a href="http://www.exumguides.com/?page_id=1962">Andy &#8220;Tank" Tankersly</a>, and <a href="http://www.exumguides.com/?page_id=1819">Zahan &#8220;Z" Billimoria</a>. After a quick gear review and signing of our forms, we drove to the Lupine Meadows trailhead and began our hike up to the Lower Saddle camp.  At 7 miles long and with a 5,000 feet elevation increase, the trail afforded us great views of the ground we had covered as the day went on.  Even after an hour of switchbacks, we had fantastic views of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taggart_Lake">Taggart</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Lake">Bradley</a> Lakes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teewinot_Mountain">Mt. Teewinot</a>.</p>

<p>We continued our hike up into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnet_Canyon">Garnet Canyon</a> past a few boulder fields and had lunch at a nice spot on some boulders with a creek and meadow and a great view of Middle Teton.  Lynne explained some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_the_Grand_Teton_area">geology of the Teton range</a> to us and we continued up the canyon further.</p>

<p>Approaching the Lower Saddle (11,600 ft.) through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moraine">moraine</a> of Garnet Canyon, the sky started to look a bit more ominous.  As we ascended the fixed rope section past a glacier and up to the saddle, it began to rain and then hail just as we arrived at camp.  We changed into some dry clothes and rode the storm out for an hour or so until the sky cleared and left us with a beautiful rainbow (alas, not a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI">double rainbow</a>) and view of the canyon below.</p>

<p>Around dinner time, we heard (and saw) a rock slide off the mountain which we later learned may have been connected to an <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Quakes/us2010zpac.php">earthquake</a> that occurred along the Teton fault that afternoon.  Following dinner and quick briefing on the next morning&#8217;s schedule with the Exum guides, we wandered around the Lower Saddle and enjoyed the sunset and scenery before retiring for the night.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>
<p>Given the amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins the first night, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s no surprise that I slept about a total of 15 minutes before getting up at 3am for our summit run.   After some breakfast &amp; gear checks, we left camp at 4am with headlamps, helmets and harnesses on to begin our ascent up through the black rock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)">dike</a> to the Upper Saddle.  Unfortunately, I started feeling the effects of the altitude (dizziness, headache, heavy breathing) as we approached the Upper Saddle. Lynne&#8217;s reassurance, tough love and knowledge of how to contol breathing and lessen the effects of the altitude were instrumental in helping me get my act together and make it to the Upper Saddle.  We arrived at Upper Saddle as the sun started to rise and proceeded to the west side of the mountain to try our hand at <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/route/160588/owen-spalding-var-owen-chimney-.html">the Owen-Spalding route</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4867247961/"><img height="360" width="480" alt="Jordan on his way to the Upper Saddle before sunrise" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4867247961_00aa884cae_z.jpg" title="Jordan on his way to the Upper Saddle before sunrise"/></a></p>
<p>The first major technical pitch of the Owen-Spalding route was the Belly Roll.  Jordan and I are both very comfortable with technical climbing on routes rated 5.9 or so in climbing gyms, but something about wearing a backpack, being over 13,000 feet above sea level (3,000 of which is a vertical cliff), wearing approach shoes instead of climbing shoes and combating wind, fatigue, and cold weather makes a 5.5 pitch seem significantly more difficult than a standard gym route.  Whatever the case, the technical climbing on the Owen-Spalding route was exhilarating and just plain fun.  After the Belly Roll, we approached The Crawl, a small section of jagged rock with about 3,000 feet of air underneath it.  I had the luxury of cleaning this route, but I was so focused on removing the quickdraw and cam that Lynne placed on the route that I didn&#8217;t notice the exposure as much as I should have.</p>

<p>After most of the technical pitches were complete,  Z diverted from the group to help a father and daughter tandem that spent the night high up on the mountain after being caught in the hailstorm from the night before and losing their way to the rappel station.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4867248477/"><img height="360" width="480" alt="Me ascending one of the final pitches before the summit" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4867248477_744f3d556f_z.jpg" title="Me ascending one of the final pitches before the summit" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>We arrived at the summit around 7:10 am.  I&#8217;m fairly certain we could see for about 100 miles, since to the north we noticed what looked like Old Faithful (or perhaps another geyser in Yellowstone) erupting.  At that time of morning, the mountain cast a shadow that was probably at least 15 miles long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4867249031/"><img height="360" width="480" alt="Finally at the summit!" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4867249031_5c8ccee75e_z.jpg" title="Finally at the summit!" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>We spent about 20 minutes enjoying the view on the summit (and even took a quick bathroom break) and then began the long down-climb &amp; rappel back to the Lower Saddle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4865176888/"><img height="640" width="480" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4865176888_ed8c6afb19_z.jpg" title="Gideon on rappel"/></a></p>
<p>Upon reaching the Lower Saddle, we wolfed down some Clif bars (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be eating any more of these for a while after this trip), changed clothes and climbed back down into the moraine and Garnet Canyon.  Arriving at the parking lot after being awake for 36 hours or so was such a feeling of relief, but I can&#8217;t stop thinking about how our time on the Grand Teton seems too short in retrospect.  We were very fortunate that the mountain gave us good weather and safe passage for our ascent to the summit.  Every guide we met at Exum was personable and passionate about mountaineering and I know all of us are thankful that Lynne, Andy and Z got us up and down the mountain safely.  Learning about the science of mountaineering and the geology behind the Teton range added a layer of depth to the trip that made it even more special.  I&#8217;m incredibly thankful for this trip to the Tetons and for the friends and family I&#8217;ve been able to share this experience with. Climbing The Grand Teton was a physical, emotional, and intellectual challenge that will be with me forever.  There&#8217;s something special about these mountains and something very deeply satisfying about accomplishing a goal that the four of us set as a team back in February. Although we&#8217;ve left the Tetons for now, I have a feeling we&#8217;ll be back&#8230;</p>

<p>Today was our final day of preparation for our ascent of The Grand Teton. Our instruction today (courtesy of Exum guide <a href="http://www.exumguides.com/?page_id=173">Lynne Wolfe</a>) built substantially on the fundamentals we learned yesterday and as a result we were able to complete 2 full multi-pitch climbs, 2 practice rappels and some bouldering and down-climbing.  The first climb of the day was The Book, a vertical series of 3 pitches with small ledges in between.</p>

<p>After completing our climb of The Book, we quickly stopped to celebrate with a lunch break and a few pictures of the surround views of the Grand Teton, Mt. Owen and Jenny Lake.</p>

<p>After lunch, we practiced rappelling down a stretch of rock which (as Lynne told us) is fairly close to the stretch we will rappel down after summiting The Grand.</p>

<p>Our final climb of the day was The Tree, a 4 pitch section of 5.5-5.7 rock that left us exhausted but happy at the progress we made during the day.</p>

<p>The past few days have been one of the best experiences of my life and I have no doubt that our time spent on The Grand tomorrow and Thursday will continue that trend, whether we reach the summit or not.  I won&#8217;t be posting any updates tomorrow night since we&#8217;ll be spending the night at the Lower Saddle (11,650 ft.), but I do hope to blog a bit once we&#8217;ve returned from our expedition on Thursday night.  Thanks to all of those (especially family) that have been following the blog this week and giving us encouragement and support throughout our time here in Jackson Hole. We&#8217;ll be thinking of you all as we start our climb tomorrow.</p>

      <p><img height="360" width="480" alt="Jordan &amp; Chris @ Exum" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4854967413_fb3c6761fd_z.jpg" align="top"/></p>
<p>The days keep getting better and better out here.  Today was our first day of multi-pitch climbing training with the guides at Exum Guides.  We took the ferry across Jenny Lake to the Exum training grounds where our guide <a href="http://www.exumguides.com/?page_id=2342">Dan Starr</a> taught us several knots, some associated vocabulary to use on the mountain, and the hip belay technique to use for low angle friction climbs.  Although Jordan and I are pretty familiar with rock climbing in a gym setting, we still found ourselves learning a lot.  Exum places a huge importance on using the right techniques for the right mountain settings (rock climbing, friction climbing, mountianeering, etc.).  Since elements like weather can closely affect the safety of climbers, moving quickly (but not rushing) as a climbing party leads to safer climbs.  Whether we are flaking rope out before a pitch, tying in, or belaying, using the appropriate technique and being prepared and ready is going to be important on the Grand.  Since we&#8217;re familiar with the concept of &#8220;ready golf," this is something that resonated well with Douglas and me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4854970945/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img title="Dan teaching Gideon some knots" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4854970945_56c1b71b7c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>After practicing the techniques in a pretty basic setting and a quick break for some lunch, we put our newfound knowledge to use climbing some pitches next to Hidden Falls.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4855605504/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img title="Douglas on the Bath Tub pitch" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4855605504_5ca2ee0e52_z.jpg" width="480" height="360" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>Upon reaching the top, Dan taught us the art of the rappel.  We&#8217;ll have to use this technique to get down a few of the big vertical stretches on the Grand Teton.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4855629196/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img title="Practicing some rappelling" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4118/4855629196_1b856a2855_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>After rappel training, Dan set up a top rope and we practiced climbing a nice 35 foot 5.7/5.8 route.  It was a blast to do some vertical climbing outdoors with great scenery all around us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4855023119/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4855023119_1ee7e280e7_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>All in all, it was a great day and a great opportunity for us to learn the ropes (no pun intended).  Tomorrow&#8217;s training will be more substantial and similar to the types of climbing we&#8217;ll be encountering on the Grand.  I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what&#8217;s in store.</p>
