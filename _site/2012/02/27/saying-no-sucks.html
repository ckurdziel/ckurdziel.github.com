<h2>Saying "No" Sucks</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Feb 2012</p>
<div class="post">
<p>I had coffee with an awesome entrepreneur over the weekend and he said something that really got me thinking: &#8220;I hate hearing no."</p>
<p>Turns out that I hate <em>saying</em> no (and this can sometimes get me in trouble). I love the feeling of being a &#8220;yes" man, having a can do attitude, and making things happen that seem like they&#8217;re not possible, but sometimes there&#8217;s a real cost associated with saying &#8220;yes."  Business school has taught me a number of things, but one the most important lessons has been how to say &#8220;no" when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve had to deliver bad news entrepreneurs we can&#8217;t invest in, tell people I can&#8217;t carve out time for a meeting because I can&#8217;t be in multiple places at multiple times, and say no to extra work because I can&#8217;t quite get it all done. </p>
<p>This has been pretty frustrating, but ultimately, I think saying no to some things just means you can say yes to others. I&#8217;m not talking about that &#8220;kinda-sorta" yes that&#8217;s driven by FOMO (fear of missing out), dilutes your focus, leads to flaky scheduling and spreads you thin. Giving someone or something a real &#8220;yes" and committing to that yes means you can devote yourself to that thing and accomplish it well. </p>
<p>In its essence, I think this boils down to one thing: <em><strong>being present</strong></em>. Pick the things in life that really matter: your family, your friends, the people, work and art that truly inspires you. You don&#8217;t have to ignore everything else, but don&#8217;t say yes to anything that compromises the level of enjoyment or excellence that you get and give to those things that really matter.</p>
