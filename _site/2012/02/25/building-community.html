<h2>Building Community</h2>
<p class="meta">25 Feb 2012</p>
<div class="post">
<p><p class="p1">YouTube recently released stats that <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2012/01/holy-nyans-60-hours-per-minute-and-4.html">60+ hours of content are being uploaded to their site per minute</a>. That sort of data is pretty impressive, but when you take a look at a lot of that content, it becomes a little less impressive. I&#8217;ve noticed an increasing amount of video responses to popular videos on YouTube that feature women with low cut shirts in the thumbnails blathering on about whatever video they&#8217;re responding to. This sort of content is not exactly enhancing the community at YouTube, so I can only assume these types of people are trying to cash in on ad revenue via traffic from the videos they&#8217;re responding to. </p>
<p class="p1">Linkbait is nothing new and I&#8217;m not the only one who has noticed this, but I was recently reminded of all this because of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJHzbXEc2so">video from reddit</a> the other day. This guy isn&#8217;t the most articulate speaker, but he makes his point pretty well. </p>
<p class="p1">Problems like this one indicate that communities and curation have become increasingly important in the online world. At <a href="http://Shelby.tv/"><span class="s1">Shelby.tv</span></a>, as we think about the future of what video community should look like, we are building the type of community that doesn&#8217;t promote the &#8220;spammy" user-generated-content (UGC) that we see on places like YouTube. Recommendations and organic UGC are great, but recommendations (especially as related to the long tail of UGC) powered without a social filter or strong context around them feel empty, spammy and often result in the lower quality kind of stuff I&#8217;m referring to here.  </p>
<p class="p1">We believe the social filter is the key to building a community of content that doesn&#8217;t promote this sort of abusive behavior and we&#8217;re really excited about sharing what we&#8217;re building with the rest of the world.  More on this soon. ;)</p></p>
