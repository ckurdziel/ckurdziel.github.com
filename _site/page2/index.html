        Killing Google Reader

      <p>Yesterday, Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html" target="_blank">announced they&#8217;re killing Reader</a>, one of their most beloved (if my Twitter stream is to be believed) products in their portfolio.</p>
<p>I use a few different apps/sites to keep up with the news. Here they are:</p>
<ul><li>Google Reader</li>
<li>Reeder (Google Reader interface for iOS)</li>
<li>Instapaper</li>
<li>Zite</li>
<li>News.Me Daily Email</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Techmeme</li>
<li>Hacker News</li>
</ul><p>I use each of these services for different reasons, and though I&#8217;ve developed a pretty good flow of how they each fit into my day, I&#8217;ve been longing for a better solution. I really wish that there was a product that tied these things together in one or two apps. What would that product look like? Here&#8217;s a quick stab and what I&#8217;d love to see for my two common use cases (daily &#8220;must reads" &amp; weekly &#8220;discovery" reading):</p>
<p><strong>Must Read: My Daily Use Case</strong></p>
<ul><li>Keep/read a curated list of the stuff I absolutely want to see on a regular basis anytime there are updates. This is the stuff I want to read no matter what and it&#8217;s mostly blogs of people who I engage with on a regular basis. (It&#8217;s what Google Reader became for me.)</li>
<li>Give me an idea of top posts in my social network. The news.me email from the Digg team does a good job of giving me stuff that I may have missed or not seen that&#8217;s highly relevant. Generally only 3-5 of these articles are really necessary to get an idea of what&#8217;s relevant in my network.</li>
<li>If there isn&#8217;t enough content on a daily basis, then don&#8217;t show me more. Let me get a few minutes of my day back.  This is a problem a lot of apps don&#8217;t consider because they&#8217;re looking for more engagement (which often times = shoving more content in front of you).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Discover: My Weekly/When I Have Time Use Case</strong></p>
<ul><li>Once I&#8217;m done with the daily read, open the floodgates and give me some variety. This could be seeded with content, topics and things I&#8217;ve shown an interest in (like Zite) or it could be powered by people I&#8217;m connected to socially. Ideally it&#8217;s a mix of all of the above.</li>
<li>If I&#8217;ve saved articles for later, show me these articles before letting me run wild exploring the ends of the internet.</li>
</ul><p>The hard part here is figuring out how to combine these use cases in an app. Part of the power is in keeping them separate: the problem with apps like Zite is that I never know if I missed an article from a &#8220;must read" site and I don&#8217;t have an interest in discovering new tangental content unless I&#8217;ve finished the stuff that I know is relevant.</p>
<p>However, one of the big problems with these weekly apps is that I often forget to go back to them on a regular basis, and they often have content in them that I&#8217;ve already seen or seen elsewhere.  There&#8217;s a strong case for a reading app that unifies these two use cases or at least is aware of what&#8217;s been consumed in the other app so that the probability of duplicates is reduced.</p>
<p>The closest thing I&#8217;ve found to this approach is called <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a>. It combines &#8220;kindling" (your daily must-reads) with &#8220;sparks" (the rest of the content you are interested in) to give you a smart reading experience.  The only problem? No iOS apps and it&#8217;s self-hosted. :/</p>
<p>Anyone else have other ideas out there? Seems that there are a ton of companies tackling this problem but no one has really hit the nail on the head yet (for me).  I&#8217;ve tried Prismatic and while I think the content it surfaces is pretty solid, I find the UX, scrolling and lack of Instapaper support absolutely maddening. Hopefully <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader">Digg</a> (or someone else) does it right.</p>
<p><em>Note: I also realize this problem is completely non-trivial to solve, that my usage pattern is probably pretty niche and that this is not something I can really pretend to solve in a blog post. Flame away. :)</em></p>

      <p>Lots of startups (especially those in NYC) spend a ton of time on visual design and making sure that the look and feel of their product is close to perfect. </p>
<p>While my obsessive tendencies often encourage me to consider every design option presented, I&#8217;ve had to remember that too much attention to design can often get in the way of moving a product forward.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a startup trying to iterate quickly, understand your customer base and think about things as an MVP, there are times when it&#8217;s smart to eschew design for shipping product (provided it doesn&#8217;t cripple functionality). That extra bit of design/attention to detail can be helpful, for sure, but a good product person should understand when that matters and when it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a great post about UX on <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671735/infographic-the-intricate-anatomy-of-ux-design">Fast.co Design</a> today and it includes the infographic above. The overall point is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To think any designer could be an expert in each of these circles is sheer absurdity, but to recognize that <strong>every end user is an expert</strong> in each of these circles is highly important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though I&#8217;d worked alongside product teams before entering the New York startup community, I&#8217;m not ashamed to admit that I never really heard the term &#8220;UX" used much. I could probably crack a joke about how that&#8217;s unexpected for people who work in big companies that develop enterprise healthcare IT applications, but I&#8217;ll refrain.</p>
<p>Being a bit of a n00b on the design front, it took me a while to appreciate the subtleties of these different areas of design. Depending on what you&#8217;re building, each area has a different level of importance, but together they all form something that&#8217;s the cornerstone of your product. </p>
<p><span>While there are many days when I wish I had more formal education on the tenets of good user experience or interaction design, I think it&#8217;s good to remember that no matter how much formal education we have, user experience comes down to putting yourself in the shoes of others </span><span>and asking &#8220;does this work for me?"</span></p>
<p><span>This empathetic approach can be helpful in UX decision-making, but it&#8217;s also a characteristic that increases chances of success in the customer support experience and in service industries. </span></p>
<p><span>I&#8217;m not saying that one has to be empathetic with the customer/user because they&#8217;re always right. On the contrary, the customer may be wrong (and angry!), but their perspective is valid and should be used to gain insight and understanding around the experience. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to the &#8220;UX" person to translate that perspective into something that is actionable/productive for all parties involved.</span></p>

<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557006/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1937557006&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chriskurdziel-20">Designing for Emotion</a>, which contains a number of interesting examples about how design can be used to evoke emotion. <span>There are a few cool examples in the book, but the one that stood out to me most was Apple&#8217;s implementation of their blinking sleep status indicator. This has been documented before (</span><a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6658577.html">and patented back in 2002</a><span>), but if anyone has wondered why their Macbook&#8217;s sleep indicator was strangely comforting it&#8217;s because the pulsating rhythm is based on the respiratory rate of a human (12-20 cycles per minute).</span></p>
<p><span>At Shelby, one of our core values is "</span><em><strong>be human</strong></em><span>" - this applies in the way we carry ourselves in the larger startup community, internally with our team and also in the way we approach building product.  This is a product philosophy that I&#8217;m increasingly taking to heart and one that I think has to be at the center of transformative technology products in slower-moving, low-tech industries.  </span></p>
<p><span>Take healthcare, for example. There are a ton of technology companies building solutions for the healthcare enterprise (I used to work at <a href="http://www.mckesson.com">one</a>), but most are just focused on performing a specific task and not providing enjoyable UX. As Aaron Walter says in </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937557006/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1937557006&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chriskurdziel-20">Designing for Emotion</a><span>, &#8220;certainly we all want to eat edible foods with nutritional value, but we also crave <em>flavor</em>." Based on my experience, design of healthcare IT systems has been focused on making products that are &#8220;edible" - they get the job done but they&#8217;re pretty crappy in terms of creating an experience that physicians feel they can&#8217;t live without.  It&#8217;s no surprise to see that adoption of healthcare tech <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/healthcare/electronic-medical-records/ehr-adoption-us-remains-the-slow-poke/240142152">is slow</a>. I believe there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for better, more human design to help speed the adoption of healthcare tech among a physician population that is short on time and patience.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone else have other examples of industries waiting to be transformed by designing with emotion?</span></p>
