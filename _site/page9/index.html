<p>Day two in the Jackson Hole area marked a plethora of animal sightings.  After waking up and feasting upon scrambled eggs and bacon, the four of us headed up to Yellowstone National Park for some sightseeing and hiking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4851674029/"><img height="360" width="480" alt="Faith+1?" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4851674029_4ef42e3479_z.jpg" title="Faith+1" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>On the way up to Yellowstone, we encountered a few moose, some elk, a bear, and later in the day we saw a gargantuan water buffalo.  I&#8217;ve been on a fair number of hikes and outdoor trips before and haven&#8217;t encountered this much wildlife at any point, so I think it&#8217;s safe to say that we were blessed to see such a variety of animals at such close proximity.  It&#8217;s always humbling to observe these powerful animals in their natural habitat and today was no exception.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4852291268/"><img height="270" width="480" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4852291268_54467bacff_z.jpg" title="Bear" align="middle" alt="Bear Sighting!"/></a></p>
<p>In Yellowstone, we saw a few of the geyser basins (including Old Faithful) and the paint pots and then hiked out to Riddle Lake.  After tiptoeing past two enormous male elk relaxing in the woods, we dipped our toes in the lake and headed back to the car.</p>

<p>Driving back from Yellowstone, we stopped at a few different places to admire the view of the Tetons and the Snake River.  Here&#8217;s my take on one of Ansel Adams&#8217; <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Adams_The_Tetons_and_the_Snake_River.jpg">best shots</a>:</p>

<p>After a long day of activity, we decided to wind down with a delicious and indulgent dinner at <a href="http://www.sudachijh.com/">Sudachi</a>, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Iguchi">Bryan Iguchi</a> served us up some incredibly fresh and delicious sushi.  Bryan is an awesome guy, great sushi chef and incredible snowboarder and I would definitely recommend that anyone interested in very high quality sushi pay him a visit at Sudachi.  Despite being Jordan&#8217;s first time eating sushi, he tried a number of sashimi plates and also ordered a seaweed salad. Hopefully all that sushi consumption will serve us well during our first day of multi-pitch climbing training tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>Today marks the first day of an adventure that I have been training for and planning for over a year.  In a few days, I&#8217;ll (hopefully) be climbing the Grand Teton here in Jackson Hole, Wyoming with my brother and two friends.  In an effort to document our trip while it is fresh in my mind and to share some of the experiences with those that aren&#8217;t able to be out here with us, I&#8217;ll be posting some photos and thoughts to the blog over the next few days.  Although today was spent in large part traveling from our respective homes to the pristine mountain sanctuary of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the four of us did manage to squeeze in a late lunch and celebrate our arrival in the Tetons with a frothy libation at the Mangy Moose.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4848506792/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img height="360" width="480" class="photo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4848506792_580b14dc5c_z.jpg" alt="Lunch @ the Mangy Moose" align="middle"/></a></p>
<p>We followed up lunch with a quick 3.2 mile round trip hike to Taggart Lake before some mountain thunderstorms blew in. The hike to the lake was relatively flat but considering we&#8217;ll be subjecting ourselves to more strenuous activity over the next few days, we all felt it was prudent to get out and get the blood pumping.  Along the trail, we encountered a mother moose and her offspring feasting on some of the local greenery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4848509938/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img height="360" width="480" alt="Moose on the way to Taggart Lake" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/4848509938_3b0eaf1aed_z.jpg" title="Moose on the way to Taggart Lake"/></a></p>
<p>Our arrival at the lake was marked by some ominous looking clouds and a fantastic view of the Grand Teton.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4848510850/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img height="360" width="480" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/4848510850_e505f0ddd4_z.jpg" title="Taggart Lake w/ Grand Teton in the Background"/></a></p>
<p>As the weather blew in, we decided to drive to the Jackson Lake Lodge and enjoy a milkshake while admiring the rest of the Teton range.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/4847889513/in/set-72157624501626001/"><img height="360" width="480" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/4847889513_8f962290f5_z.jpg" title="A pensive Jordan enjoys the cool mountain air after a chocolate milkshake."/></a></p>
<p>All in all, today was a great first day in the mountains that has left us all exhausted but nonetheless fervently awaiting the week that is to come.  I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the people I&#8217;m here with or our goals for the week.</p>

      <p>When the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> was first announced, many of my friends quickly <a href="http://twitter.com/tanousjm/statuses/11276072234">made fun of it</a>.  Admittedly, I had some of the same thoughts and was pretty disappointed to find out that the iPad didn&#8217;t allow multitasking, access to the file system, or any application that wasn&#8217;t pre-approved by Apple.  Ultimately, I think the iPad&#8217;s <em>lack </em>of  appeal to technology zealots may be the defining and polarizing characteristic that causes it to transform the consumer tech industry.  <a href="http://www.chriskurdziel.com/blog/option-paralysis-creative-passion/">In my post last week</a>, I talked about the idea of using technology for something useful and creative rather than just because it&#8217;s &#8220;cool."  Apple has traditionally built technology that gets out of its own way, but the simplicity of the iPad takes it beyond previous efforts (and maybe even a little too far).  Tech fans (and even some Apple fanboys) haven&#8217;t been excited about the iPad because from a technology standpoint, <em>there&#8217;s really nothing exciting about it</em>.  The iPhone was a phone that acted more like a computer - it let us do more than we used to be able to do with our phones.  But the iPad is a computer that acts less like a computer - it&#8217;s a device that lets us do stuff we&#8217;ve already been doing in a different way.  By removing the &#8220;tech" from our technology, Apple is providing us with a blank slate (pardon the iPun) for computing.  For those of us that are used to hiding behind the allure of technology, this is a little like taking away our security blanket.  The future of personal computing isn&#8217;t the &#8220;computing" part, it&#8217;s the &#8220;personal" part.  Apple isn&#8217;t the only company with this mindset.  Google&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> is effectively just a web browser and won&#8217;t provide a whole lot more in the way of features than the iPad does.  Tablets with Chrome OS (or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>) will likely be cheaper than Apple&#8217;s initial offerings, but both companies are moving toward a simplified OS model for the majority of personal computing with heavy emphasis on access to the cloud.  After all this iPad banter, you might expect that I&#8217;m buying one during launch this weekend.  It turns out that I&#8217;m fine waiting for the next iteration, where I&#8217;ll probably find some of the things I&#8217;ve been missing (multitasking, better file system access) at a lower price.  The iPad is no <a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/23520/">JesusTablet</a>, but it is an important signal that the future of personal computing is going to be vastly different than its past 30 years.  The iPad won&#8217;t change the fact that many of us geeks will still want to tinker and toy with our technology.  The good news is that we can find new and interesting ways to do that both because of and in spite of the iPad.</p>

        Option Paralysis & Creative Passion

      <p>I had the privilege of seeing The Dillinger Escape Plan perform at the Masquerade in Atlanta earlier this week.  They&#8217;ve been touring in support of their new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Option-Paralysis-Spec-Dillinger-Escape/dp/B0036APQ2S">Option Paralysis</a>, which is my favorite record of 2010 (so far).  To many, Dillinger&#8217;s music is discordant and sonically overwhelming.  While that is largely true, there&#8217;s a lot to discover beneath the abrasive exterior of their music. </p>
<p>Most people initially get into The Dillinger Escape Plan because of their incredible technical proficiency and wide array of influences (jazz, punk, metal, etc), but beneath the precise mathematical playing, the music has a substantial artistic and musical subtext.  Many of Option Paralysis&#8217;s themes refer to the wide array of choices and information we have in a world of technology that often cripple us from creating anything of value.  Watching the members of the D.E.P. perform with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdVCmWDiKc">reckless abandon</a> while still nailing all the parts technically was nothing sort of jaw-dropping.  Aside from being the most intense live music experience I&#8217;ve ever had, the show left a substantial impression on how passionate the guys in the band are about what they do.  </p>
<p>Whether you like the music or not, I think we can all agree that lending our own creative and passionate instincts to whatever we do in life is a rewarding and productive thing.  One of the reasons I love technology is that it simplifies many aspects of my life and generally enables me to do more with less.   However, every so often I catch myself checking Twitter or posting a relatively banal Facebook update out of habit rather than because I have something useful or creative to say.  This is a reminder that technology can sometimes deprive us of the opportunity to unlock our own creativity if we lose sight of its role as a means to an end rather than the end itself.</p>
<p>When we use technology, let&#8217;s not forget to harness its power for creative ends.  It&#8217;s important to stay connected to those around us and learn about new technologies, but not at the expense of creating something meaningful and contributing to the world around us with passion. And whether you enjoy The Dillinger Escape Plan&#8217;s music or not, hopefully you can agree that the statement they make on their album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Option-Paralysis-Spec-Dillinger-Escape/dp/B0036APQ2S">Option Paralysis</a>, and live, on stage, is an important and valuable one.  In a world without originality, creativity and passion, we&#8217;re left saying "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY-JkeXK4dU">Farewell, Mona Lisa</a>."</p>

      <p>Like Apple&#8217;s announcement of the iPad before it, Google Buzz has been generating a lot of&#8230; buzz&#8230; in the tech community.  Ironically, I&#8217;ve received most of this &#8220;buzz" via tweets in my Twitter feed.   Most of my contacts that have adopted Buzz are either feeding in existing content from other sources (Google Reader, Twitter, etc.) or posting Buzz updates about the Buzz service itself rather than generating unique content.  As such, I have found little use for Buzz in its current form.  Buzz&#8217;s implementation is satisfactory and there are a number of great features.  I&#8217;m not interested in delving into too many of the design choices Google made here, <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/02/thoughts-on-buzz.html">as other blogs</a> have great insight and discussion on some of the feature choices.   Google&#8217;s choice to include Buzz in GMail, their decision to auto-follow GMail contacts rather than prompt before following, and their decision to make the service opt-out rather than opt-in have all proven controversial.  Many of these decisions seem to be strategic in nature and therefore understandable from Google&#8217;s perspective, but they mark an interesting attitude that seems to be increasingly prevalent and at odds with much of the internet community: that the company creating the product often knows better than its users.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out over the long term.  Strategic decisions aside, the Buzz product itself still confuses me.  Twitter serves its purpose as a way for me to interact with the larger internet community.   Facebook allows me to connect with the network of those that I know.   These distinct social graphs seem suited for different services, hence my need for both.   Buzz seems to occupy a strange space in the middle (similar to FriendFeed) and hasn&#8217;t developed enough identity yet to push me toward using it regularly.  While I really like the idea of pushing more relevant results to the top of the feed, the lack of any distinct sorting or timeline (like Twitter) makes it confusing to read updates.  I&#8217;ve found myself re-reading posts multiple times just because someone I don&#8217;t know has commented on them and pushed the post back to the top of my list. Muting these conversations is an option, but manually managing all of this is much less elegant that a solution that just works.  Part of the beauty of products like Twitter and Facebook (in its earlier stages) is that they accomplish their objective very well even if they don&#8217;t do much else.  Buzz doesn&#8217;t really do anything well but does a lot of things decently, and as a result it strikes me as a product that is more derivative and less innovative.  This will please some, but it hasn&#8217;t captured me yet.  So, what will the future hold? If knowledge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_birds_and_the_bees">reproduction</a> tells us anything, the bird (Twitter) and the bee (Buzz) will produce some sort of evolutionary superior organism.  Whether it is ultimately a success or a failure, Google&#8217;s entry into the social market should at the very least inspire other big players like Facebook, Twitter, and others to continue rolling out new and innovative features.  That&#8217;s a good thing for everybody.  Reader(s), what are your thoughts on Buzz?  I&#8217;d love to get some discussion going in the comments below.</p>
