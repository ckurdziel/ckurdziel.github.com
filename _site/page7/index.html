      <p>I had the distinct pleasure of attending my second TechStars Demo Day this Wednesday in Boston and once again, it was an awesome event and a great celebration of startups. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/scottkirsner">Scott Kirsner</a> has written <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/06/the_demo_day_dispatch_techstar.html">a great recap</a> of each company, so I won&#8217;t regurgitate the same information he has already provided, but I will throw down some thoughts on which companies I thought were most interesting to me.</p>
<p><img align="middle" height="500" width="500" alt="You shall not pass." src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5239/5840259047_675cd9f310_z.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.evertrue.com/">Evertrue</a> - Social Donor Intelligence Platform</strong></p>
<p>Interesting and intuitive product - as someone who has sat on alumni boards and been involved in alumni development, I agree that there is definitely a huge problem of keeping donor databases up to date (CEO/Co-Founder Brent Grinna indicated that typical donor databases are 80% inaccurate).  In fact, I can&#8217;t think of a single school I&#8217;ve attended that has a completely correct profile of what I&#8217;m up to and where I am.</p>
<p>These guys are already a preferred API partner with LinkedIn, have generated over $125k in revenue (not sure whether this is recurring or not) and have signed up 26 clients (including Cornell) since starting TechStars.  Impressive stuff.   Not sure whether the market is big enough for a home run type exit, but they look like they are building a really strong business and have good traction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://kinvey.com/">Kinvey</a> - Ridiculously easy cloud backend for mobile apps (aka Backend as a Service or BaaS)</strong></p>
<p>Pick any app SDK of your choice, write your app, model your backend needs, and Kinvey auto generates your backend for you. I was initially skeptical of Kinvey, but when CEO Sravish Sridhar filled his presentation with quotable lines like, &#8220;Get ready, we&#8217;re going to talk about back ends" and &#8220;We put the BaaS in BadaSs," I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed.  Word on the street was that he re-did the entire pitch and presentation only hours before Demo Day. Whether that&#8217;s true or not, I thought he did a phenomenal job and that Kinvey turned out to be the &#8220;OnSwipe" of the Boston&#8217;s Demo Day (though Sravish lacked Jason Baptiste&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ckurdziel/5618757509/">killer fashion sense</a>).  </p>
<p>With the millions of apps out there that are already built and need to add backend/cloud functionality, these guys have a large addressable market and a very real opportunity.  Kinvey has some big name investors on board (Atlas Ventures leading the round with $1MM, Bill Burnam (former SoftBank VC)) so it looks like I&#8217;m not the only one that was impressed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://grabcad.com/">GrabCAD</a> - Global engineering services marketplace, community &amp; cross-platform CAD library</strong></p>
<p>GrabCAD came across like a GitHub for mechanical engineers. In just a few short months since arriving in the US, they&#8217;ve already added 8,500 engineers to their community (7,000 in the last month!). No surprise since these former Skype employees have been around the block before.  Looks like they&#8217;ve raised some serious green from some very big name investors (Atlas Ventures, Matrix Partners, NextView Ventures).  I really love GrabCAD&#8217;s focus on physical engineering (not always the sexiest of industries) and think that they&#8217;ve picked a really interesting problem to solve and are moving very quickly in an underserved market. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://ginger.io/">Ginger.io</a> - Personal Health. Real Data. All from your mobile phone</strong></p>
<p>This team from MIT&#8217;s thesis hinges on the complete lack of data in healthcare.  I tend to agree with them.  There&#8217;s a boatload of money spent each year trying to gather all kinds of data and a ton of other healthcare products out there focused on gathering<span> </span> it, but no one has come up with a foolproof way to get data from patients in a reliable way.  Just ask the people at Google Health.</p>
<p>Though Ginger.io had no word on the commitments for their 800k round yet, I think the problem they&#8217;re trying to solve is a huge one and if they can capture just a fraction of the market, they&#8217;ll be successful.  I&#8217;m a big believer in big data being one of the most important advances that will change the future of healthcare, and as such, I think their success will hinge on whether or not the data they are gathering is an accurate and useful predictor for the companies they sell the data to.  Similarly, even though the phone apps they are developing don&#8217;t need to be used to actively gather data, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how they keep users engaged and willing to continue providing this type of data, especially if it&#8217;s being sold in aggregate to big healthcare companies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.memrise.com/welcome/">Memrise</a> - Blends the art &amp; science of memory to power a social learning platform</strong></p>
<p>Ed Cooke, Memrise&#8217;s CEO, is one of 36 "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Master_of_Memory">Grand Masters of Memory</a>" in the world. Yes, that is actually an official title. During the break in pitches, Ed recited a few minutes of Paradise Lost completely from memory and then got up on stage and taught the entire audience two chinese characters in a matter of minutes.  This was a fantastic and engaging presentation (along with Kinvey&#8217;s, probably the most entertaining of the day).  I have a few doubts about the ability of this business to scale, but if Memrise can keep users engaged and broaden the variety of topics available on the site while still keeping the quality high, I think they&#8217;ll kick some serious booty.</p>
<p>Overall, the day was a great celebration for the Boston community (though I&#8217;m still partial to NYC). Looking forward to seeing what Boulder Demo Day has in store!</p>

        Implicit Graphs and Social Recommendations

      <p>Yesterday I had the chance to attend a fantastic event over at Union Square Venture&#8217;s new office about social discovery and the implicit social graph.  The event was hosted by a panel of experts from startups that are on the cutting edge of using these types of graphs to make recommendations (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ericfriedman">Eric Friedman</a> from Foursquare, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ro_gupta">Ro Gupta</a> from Disqus, Marc Leibowitz from StumbleUpon, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shaival">Shaival Shah</a> from Hunch, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mcoatney">Mark Coatney</a> from Tumblr)</p>
<p>The panel was largely conversational in nature and the discussion sparked a host of interesting questions about the way that explicit actions (such as a Foursquare checkin) can lead to implicit recommendations (the Foursquare Explore feature, for example). </p>
<p>A few interesting points from the discussion:</p>
<ul><li>With each explicit input added to a pool of data, the implicit output often becomes stronger.  For example, as I check into more venues on Foursquare, I give the service a better and better idea of what kinds of places might be relevant to me.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s very easy to quickly pigeonhole taste or intent based on a user&#8217;s explicit action, but this often leads to big issues.  Eric Friedman brought up a great example: if I only check in to Italian restaurants on Foursquare, does that mean that I only eat Italian food, that I use Foursquare as a database of my Italian restaurants, or that by chance I&#8217;ve just been on an Italian streak lately and would rather see different recommendations in the future?  Subtle distinctions, but non-trivial problems to solve for the end user.</li>
<li>There is a certain amount of noise associated with explicit connections that are shared by large numbers of people.  For example, if you like the Jonas Brothers and a million other people also like the Jonas Brothers, implying that we have a bunch in common on other fronts because of our mutual Jonas-love is less relevant than if we were both fans of a more obscure band (any <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Qnr1gOdpU">Decrepit Birth</a> fans out there?).</li>
<li>Implicit recommendations in services such as Pandora need to be carefully managed.  For example, if Pandora simply provided you with an implicit stream of music based on aggregated psychographic variables (all the artists you like and listen to), they would ignore the fact that you&#8217;re often in different moods.  They solve this problem by having the user create channels of different artists so that recommendations are driven by a general mood or theme and each individual channel is driven by psychographic variables.</li>
<li>Metadata can be a powerful tool when it comes to building implied social graphs. Pandora&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project">Music Genome Project</a> is a great example of how this data can be used to generate implicit recommendations.</li>
</ul><p>Figuring out how to provide useful social discovery is a difficult problem to solve, so I&#8217;m going to be thinking about this one a whole bunch more.  Share some thoughts in the comments below and let&#8217;s get some disqussion started!</p>

      <p>This post may not come as a surprise for those that have been following what I&#8217;ve been up to the past few months during spring semester of my first year at business school, but I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled to announce that today is my first day of my summer internship at <strong>Shelby.tv</strong>. </p>
<p>For those interested in the story of how this internship happened (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/reecepacheco/status/72398570136936449">not like this</a>), I&#8217;ll lay out a quick narrative. My journey to Shelby.tv was far more serendipitous than <a href="http://blog.hashable.com/2011/05/02/for-the-love-of-hashable-welcome-john-exley/">John Exely&#8217;s journey to Hashable</a>, but hopefully the experience/advice outlined here will underscore how to create the kind of luck that got me in front of one of the most awesome startups I&#8217;ve seen this year. </p>
<p>Many of my classmates in business school gave me crap for being active on twitter and tech blogs (you&#8217;d think I was on MySpace or something), but that has probably been the single largest factor in increasing my chances for meeting influential people in the technology community (in NY and elsewhere).  I had a few interactions with <a href="http://www.reecepacheco.com">Reece</a> (shelby.tv&#8217;s co-founder) via twitter, which ultimately led to a conversation over the phone after he <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/post/3048426850/looking-for-bad-ass-interns-in-nyc">posted that they were looking for interns</a>.  One thing led to another, and I found myself doing work for the Shelby.tv team during the latter half of their TechStars stint, which in turn gave me the credibility to convert my part time internship into something full time for the summer.</p>
<p>To aspiring future Shelby.tv interns (or anyone interested in a job at a startup), a few quick recommendations:</p>
<p><strong>1) Be active on social media &amp; web services in the vertical you are interested in.</strong> I think to many this goes without saying (but a few of my business school brethren could learn from this).  The first thing many potential employers do is Google you.  If you don&#8217;t have some sort of presence or are easy to contact online, chances are you may not fit very well with a tech company&#8217;s culture (there are, of course, exceptions to this rule). You should be using all of the services in the space you hope to get into.  Also, <a href="http://shel.tv/l6SLtv">make sure you aren&#8217;t on MySpace</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2) Be authentic &amp; have an opinion.</strong>  Trying to present some facade of what you want to be over the internet is reasonably easy (especially if you hang out on /b/), but as soon as people meet you in real life they&#8217;ll quickly discover whether your presentation is authentic or not.  When you show up at a startup for a meeting, know what they do, how you think you can help, and a little bit about their culture and background.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-arnon/a-foursquare-graduation-j_b_545528.html">Tristan Walker&#8217;s story is a great example</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>3) Demonstrate enthusiasm but don&#8217;t be overzealous. </strong> It&#8217;s great to be excited about startups (and you definitely need to be persistent), but know why you are excited about the particular startup or the space they are in and be able to talk about it.  Don&#8217;t just be excited because you&#8217;re excitable and think that social game mechanics with location based group buying is going to be the next big thing.  If that&#8217;s more your cup of tea, <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/221270/love-you-bay-bay">try being a Jonas Brothers fan</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve gotten these points out of the way, I just want to reiterate two (of many) things about Shelby.tv that have me really excited to be here for the summer:</p>
<p><strong>1) In just a few short months, Shelby.tv has changed the way I watch and discover video.</strong> I&#8217;ve gotten to see Shelby.tv as a product evolve since it&#8217;s inception in February. It&#8217;s a product that scratches an itch I&#8217;ve been having for quite some time now and it&#8217;s come a LONG way in a few short months.  The ultimate vision for the product is really impressive and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing it change the way others watch and discover video over the next few months.  If you&#8217;re interested in being on the cutting edge of that change, sign up for our alpha at <a href="http://shelby.tv"><a href="http://shelby.tv">http://shelby.tv</a></a>!</p>
<p><strong>2) The team is one of the most impressive I&#8217;ve had the chance to meet.</strong> Sure, they have the technical chops, a few ivy league degrees, a PhD in physics, are ex-pro athletes, and they&#8217;re all ridiculously good looking (I&#8217;m talking about you, Dan). But what really impresses me about the team is the camaraderie, focus, humility, and passion with which they operate.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s to <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/05/10/constructive-summer.html">building something awesome this summer</a> and thanks to the team for having me on board for the ride!<span> </span></p>

      <p>I had a great conversation with <a href="http://reecepacheco.com/">Reece Pacheco</a> recently about startups and entrepreneurship.  Reece made a point that many of the entrepreneurs he has met have a penchant for risk that seems to spill into their personal lives.  That got me thinking about my rock climbing habit and how my experiences climbing are relevant in the startup world.  </p>
<p>When my guide on Grand Teton told me I was going to be over 2000 feet in the air and responsible for cleaning the protective gear off the route (hopefully without dropping it), I started to get a little worried about my ability to maintain composure and focus in the face of what I expected to be extreme fear.  As we started the Owen-Spalding route, I had been hit pretty heavily by the effects of altitude and had wondered whether I would actually make it to the top of the mountain without taking a stop on the vomit train.  After focusing on one step at a time, we arrived at the Crawl, where only a few weeks earlier, a climber had fallen to his death in a storm. Though the weather was good and I was feeling a little better, I kept telling myself not to look down as I ascended the pitch.  </p>

<p>While I&#8217;m still in the safe haven of business school, I think often about how my time on Grand Teton (specifically on the Crawl) will serve me in the startup world when I graduate.  I remember being so focused on the next holds that I had little time to consider the vast expanse of unforgiving air beneath my feet. In the context of entrepreneurship, it&#8217;s great to think about the &#8220;big picture," strategy and avoiding failure. After all, most of the successful startups certainly aim big in terms of their vision.  But when it comes to execution, the quickest way to the top is to just focus on the next handhold.</p>

      <p>This past Wednesday, I was fortunate enough to attend two great sessions with leaders in the startup world: <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/about">Brad Feld</a> of TechStars/Foundry Group (and now <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/02/startup-america-partnership.html">Startup America</a>) and <a href="http://foundercollective.com/people/Bill-Trenchard">Bill Trenchard</a> of Founder Collective &amp; Readyforce (big thanks to <a href="http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/Faculty-And-Research/Profile.aspx?id=zjs2">Zach Shulman</a> @Cornell for putting these together).   It&#8217;s fantastic to see people like Brad and Bill taking the time to <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2011/02/two-days-of-entrepreneurial-community-building-in-upstate-new-york.html">engage with entrepreneurial communities that are more off the beaten path</a> (ahem, Ithaca) than the more traditional hotbeds of innovation.  More proof that these guys really do practice what they preach and have a vested interest in seeing more and more startups succeed. </p>
<p>A few points from Brad&#8217;s talk at Cornell:</p>
<ol><li>Mentorship is incredibly important to creating a striving entrepreneurial community.  Get out there and talk to as many people as you can  (VCs, CEOs, whoever you can get your hands on)!</li>
<li>Encouraging first time entrepreneurship is just as vital as encouraging veterans to continue starting businesses. Brad shared an anecdote about his first experience as an entrepreneur and how he evaluated the risk of failure: &#8220;Could I eat? Yes. Okay, keep going."  This is one I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about, especially in the context of the traditionally risk-averse MBA curriculum.  How do we get more top performing MBAs to forgo consulting and banking jobs and join or start startups?</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a certain cognitive dissonance in &#8220;trying" to be an entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurs do or do not (thanks, Yoda!).</li>
<li>The people are the most important and valuable part of the process.</li>
</ol><p>The last point is one that I think really captures what I love about the startup ecosystem.  In the past few months, I&#8217;ve been to the Bay Area, Boston, and New York.  No matter where I am, I&#8217;m struck by the willingness of startup CEOs, VCs, and others to share their passion for startups and talk about what gets them up in the morning.  Being involved in this kind of community is incredibly infectious and I can&#8217;t help but look forward to getting even more immersed in things this summer and after graduation.  </p>
