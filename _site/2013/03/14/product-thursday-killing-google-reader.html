<h2>Killing Google Reader</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Mar 2013</p>
<div class="post">
<p>Yesterday, Google <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html" target="_blank">announced they&#8217;re killing Reader</a>, one of their most beloved (if my Twitter stream is to be believed) products in their portfolio.</p>
<p>I use a few different apps/sites to keep up with the news. Here they are:</p>
<ul><li>Google Reader</li>
<li>Reeder (Google Reader interface for iOS)</li>
<li>Instapaper</li>
<li>Zite</li>
<li>News.Me Daily Email</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Techmeme</li>
<li>Hacker News</li>
</ul><p>I use each of these services for different reasons, and though I&#8217;ve developed a pretty good flow of how they each fit into my day, I&#8217;ve been longing for a better solution. I really wish that there was a product that tied these things together in one or two apps. What would that product look like? Here&#8217;s a quick stab and what I&#8217;d love to see for my two common use cases (daily &#8220;must reads" &amp; weekly &#8220;discovery" reading):</p>
<p><strong>Must Read: My Daily Use Case</strong></p>
<ul><li>Keep/read a curated list of the stuff I absolutely want to see on a regular basis anytime there are updates. This is the stuff I want to read no matter what and it&#8217;s mostly blogs of people who I engage with on a regular basis. (It&#8217;s what Google Reader became for me.)</li>
<li>Give me an idea of top posts in my social network. The news.me email from the Digg team does a good job of giving me stuff that I may have missed or not seen that&#8217;s highly relevant. Generally only 3-5 of these articles are really necessary to get an idea of what&#8217;s relevant in my network.</li>
<li>If there isn&#8217;t enough content on a daily basis, then don&#8217;t show me more. Let me get a few minutes of my day back.  This is a problem a lot of apps don&#8217;t consider because they&#8217;re looking for more engagement (which often times = shoving more content in front of you).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Discover: My Weekly/When I Have Time Use Case</strong></p>
<ul><li>Once I&#8217;m done with the daily read, open the floodgates and give me some variety. This could be seeded with content, topics and things I&#8217;ve shown an interest in (like Zite) or it could be powered by people I&#8217;m connected to socially. Ideally it&#8217;s a mix of all of the above.</li>
<li>If I&#8217;ve saved articles for later, show me these articles before letting me run wild exploring the ends of the internet.</li>
</ul><p>The hard part here is figuring out how to combine these use cases in an app. Part of the power is in keeping them separate: the problem with apps like Zite is that I never know if I missed an article from a &#8220;must read" site and I don&#8217;t have an interest in discovering new tangental content unless I&#8217;ve finished the stuff that I know is relevant.</p>
<p>However, one of the big problems with these weekly apps is that I often forget to go back to them on a regular basis, and they often have content in them that I&#8217;ve already seen or seen elsewhere.  There&#8217;s a strong case for a reading app that unifies these two use cases or at least is aware of what&#8217;s been consumed in the other app so that the probability of duplicates is reduced.</p>
<p>The closest thing I&#8217;ve found to this approach is called <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a>. It combines &#8220;kindling" (your daily must-reads) with &#8220;sparks" (the rest of the content you are interested in) to give you a smart reading experience.  The only problem? No iOS apps and it&#8217;s self-hosted. :/</p>
<p>Anyone else have other ideas out there? Seems that there are a ton of companies tackling this problem but no one has really hit the nail on the head yet (for me).  I&#8217;ve tried Prismatic and while I think the content it surfaces is pretty solid, I find the UX, scrolling and lack of Instapaper support absolutely maddening. Hopefully <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader">Digg</a> (or someone else) does it right.</p>
<p><em>Note: I also realize this problem is completely non-trivial to solve, that my usage pattern is probably pretty niche and that this is not something I can really pretend to solve in a blog post. Flame away. :)</em></p>
