<h2>House of Cards: The Content Wars Are A Game of Thrones</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Apr 2013</p>
<div class="post">
<p>House of Cards has gotten a ton of attention lately for a few reasons:</p>
<ul><li><span>It&#8217;s an awesome show (though I haven&#8217;t seen it yet)</span></li>
<li><span>All episodes were delivered at the same time (to satisfy binge viewers)</span></li>
<li><span>It&#8217;s another major step for Netflix in delivering unique content to keep viewers locked into their model</span></li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Why is this model smart?</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Content providers can use exclusive content to be valuable &amp; differentiate themselves from competitors.</strong></em> Netflix has already done this with Lilyhammer.  They&#8217;ve also continued tapping into<span> "binge viewing" behavior in an organized way.  Although it&#8217;s unclear what the biggest benefits of that behavior will be quite yet, they&#8217;re learning something valuable by being a first mover here. </span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>People want access to content without restrictions</strong></em> and aside from being the only place to access it, Netflix&#8217;s distribution models is working for consumers with a &#8220;watch where you want, when you want" mindset.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What are the downsides of this model?</span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>It&#8217;s really expensive and only works for top-quality content.</strong></em> Because its so expensive to do it this way (and therefore the costs of failure are high), it only works for top caliber content and therefore isn&#8217;t something that will be the only way things are done. It&#8217;s why &#8220;pilots" exist in TV - see if the audience likes it and then sink more money into it. Episodic content that follows this model also has a benefit of giving viewers a reason to come back to a service. In that sense I think we&#8217;ll see these models mix.</p>
<p><em><strong>Piracy is still going to be a big issue.</strong></em> If you don&#8217;t subscribe to Netflix or the service, there&#8217;s no way to get the content except pirating it. That&#8217;s part of the reason Game of Thrones was pirated a ton (and consequently was so successful). Many of the dynamics in <a href="http://liisten.com/strategy-for-releasing-music-online" target="_blank">this post</a> on the music industry could also apply to video content. We still haven&#8217;t seen a producer of content fully embrace the piracy engine to positive effect yet.</p>
<p><span><strong>What does this all mean for the people playing this &#8220;game of thrones" in the content landscape?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The implications of all of this are good for startups - Americans watch over 5 hours a day of content and not all of it is that &#8220;top notch" stuff like House of Cards or Game of Thrones. Startups don&#8217;t need to unseat that &#8220;top value" content quite yet - they can let this game of thrones happen and focus more on the Torso of TV (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/06/the-power-of-torso-tv-why-media-is-racing-to-the-middle/" target="_blank">read Suster&#8217;s post if you haven&#8217;t</a>) and create a ton of value around providing meaningful context and discovery for the rest of the video landscape.</span></p>
