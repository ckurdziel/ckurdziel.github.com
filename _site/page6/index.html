      <p>I&#8217;ve met a host of people this summer as a part of my <a href="http://chriskurdziel.com/2011/05/23/what-im-doing-this-summer-and-why-the-heck-you-should-care.html">internship with Shelby.tv</a> and while most in the early stage tech community tend to see the huge potential in what we&#8217;re doing, a few question the application of such a technology to do anything consequential other than keep friends up to date on the latest memes that are circling the internet (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI1FP3czJnY">I&#8217;m looking at you, courage wolf</a>).</p>
<p>Founder&#8217;s Fund <a href="http://www.foundersfund.com/the-future">published an article recently</a> with few really interesting points, one of which is that &#8220;we wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."  While it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;d love to see more truly transformational tech companies, I tend to agree more with Chris Dixon that the &#8220;next big thing" <a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/">will look like a toy at first</a>.  After all, Twitter seemed like a toy (and still does to a bunch of people), but it has profoundly changed the way that people communicate and interact with one another.  In its current form, Shelby is somewhat of a toy (one that I happen to love) and while she can certainly be used for spreading nyan cat love far and wide, I&#8217;d say that our vision of the future of Shelby is far more than that.</p>
<p>Internet video shouldn&#8217;t just be a medium that&#8217;s relegated to tomfoolery and humor.  While I love that stuff as much as the next guy (probably more), when you think about the sheer number of people in this country that sit on their asses and watch TV for hours a day, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity to put some really interesting and engaging content in front of people that might not otherwise see it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already discovered a ton of video in Shelby that I wouldn&#8217;t have taken the time to notice otherwise. Here are a few quick examples from the past week or so:</p>
<ol><li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0af00UcTO-c">Educational Content</a></strong> - I&#8217;m a huge fan of TED talks, but there&#8217;s such a wide swath of content on the TED website that it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO6XEQIsCoM">often difficult to get through and figure out what I want to watch</a>.  Not so when my friends are filtering that content for me - I&#8217;ve got the best of relevant TED Talks (<a href="http://shel.tv/q5X5ez">like this one</a>) delivered to my feed in Shelby.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://shel.tv/p7i1ae">Climbing videos</a> &amp; <a href="http://shel.tv/qTJYZV">extreme sports videos</a></strong> - <a href="http://shel.tv/mZV06x">these</a> have inspired me to set ambitious goals for myself in terms of summiting mountains and pushing myslef to get better at the things I do.  I also find the cinematography in videos like this absolutely breathtaking and when viewed in HD on a great monitor, they&#8217;re a nice escape from the concrete jungle of NYC.</li>
<li><strong>Political content </strong>- I&#8217;ve been out of town for the last few days and as such I&#8217;m not spending as much time keeping up with the news as I normally do. I signed into Shelby and was quickly able to see highlights on what is going on in London with the riots and the financial markets. I also found the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%E2%80%8B=0cbVW_QS2eE">occasional comic relief</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Creative content from Tumblr - </strong>If you follow more than a few people on Tumblr, you probably realize that the Dashboard is not the most effective way of viewing video content.  Most videos go unwatched since I quickly scan my Dashboard only once or twice a day.  Since we&#8217;ve been testing tumblr integration recently, I&#8217;ve stumbled across a few fun and educational gems: "<a href="http://shel.tv/r7HmYR">carnivorous plants</a>" and "<a href="http://shel.tv/r9lGgw">vortex bubbles</a>."</li>
</ol><p>These videos have captured my imagination and inspired me to make the most of my time outside of the office and away from the computer.  They require less than 30 minutes of my attention a day.  Shelby can be that kind of &#8220;video sherpa" for all our users.  All this content is accessible to everyone for the first time thanks to the internet (sorry, cable, you still kind of suck) and given the rate at which this stuff is growing, it&#8217;s even more important to help people find the video that moves them and the people in their lives.  </p>
<p>Sure, some of you may think I&#8217;m just trying to justify my love of the memefilled internet, but I really do believe that video is an incredibly engaging and interesting medium that can help change the world.  Just like music, <em><strong>video can transcend language barriers, connect, inspire and educate</strong></em> (<a href="http://shel.tv/q5X5ez">just ask Salman Khan about that last one</a>).</p>
<p>Video is a young art form - it&#8217;s been around a fraction of the time that music, literature and theatre have.  <em><strong>Much like Gutenberg&#8217;s printing press did for the written word in the 1400&#8217;s, the internet is enabling video to be widely and cheaply distributed in a way unlike ever before.</strong></em>  And if video is still so young, then the future is bright. Sounds like music to my…err… video to my eyes. </p>

      <p>Internet traffic is growing at an alarming rate.  Given the amount of total IP traffic growth that will occur over the next 5-10 years (we&#8217;re supposed to hit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns341/ns525/ns537/ns705/ns827/white_paper_c11-481360_ns827_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html">zettabyte threshhold by the end of 2015</a>), I think it&#8217;s safe to say we&#8217;ll see a lot of reinvestment in network infrastructure to help alleviate some of the costs of delivering all this data.  In order to pay for all this, I suspect it&#8217;s also likely that we may see some companies buck the trend of &#8220;unlimited bandwidth" in favor of tiered pricing, much like AT&amp;T has already done with their iPhone pricing plans.  If this is the case, users will start indirectly paying for even the &#8220;free" services that they use on a monthly basis.  </p>
<p>For those products that rely on serving ads as part of their business model, any sort of tiered data pricing model could be problematic (especially in data heavy verticals like the video market).  Most consumers aren&#8217;t happy when you show them ads that aren&#8217;t relevant to them, but imagine CHARGING them for these kinds of ads.  This could affect consumer internet behavior pretty substantially, even if the pricing model changes only slightly.  There are certainly arguments in favor of legislation to help curb this sort of change, and while it&#8217;s not my intention to get into a net neutrality discussion, I&#8217;m in <a target="_blank" href="http://continuations.com/post/941652303/net-neutrality-is-critical-for-innovation">agreement with a bunch of people who are a lot smarter than me</a> about most of that topic.</p>
<p>Where am I going with all of this?  Well, I signed up for Spotify&#8217;s free trial to spend some time testing out the service, and while I&#8217;ve been enjoying it enough, I had a rather jarring experience yesterday with the advertising.   I was in a groove listening to some rather brutal death metal (don&#8217;t judge) when an audio ad interrupted my blast-beat-ridden-Nile-fest to tell me that some mediocre indie band I had no interest in had exclusive content available on Spotify.  Pretty much every subsequent ad on the service was equally uninteresting to me and totally interrupted the flow of my zen-like death metal trance.  </p>
<p>I understand that Spotify&#8217;s free model probably isn&#8217;t how they&#8217;re making the bulk of their money and that the goal is to drive me toward being a paid subscriber, but serving me ads like these is NOT helping.  Google does a pretty good job of serving up relevant and unobtrusive advertising in the text/search world, but they&#8217;re still struggling with highly relevant ads on YouTube and elsewhere.  If the ad-based model is to survive in the future of the internet, we need to do a whole lot better job at delivering engaging ads to users (especially if they&#8217;re going to pay for them indirectly through tiered bandwidth plans).</p>

      <p>A friend of mine at Intel Capital was in town a week or two ago and we sat down to have a long discussion about the future of TV and how social media and computing would integrate onto the big screen. He&#8217;s been seeing an increasing convergence of computing and entertainment, so it&#8217;s no surprise that in my brief time at Shelby.tv this summer, I&#8217;ve seen a host of new entrants in this space from enhanced social TV experiences like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/07/socialguide-raises-1-5-million-for-social-tv-guide/">SocialGuide</a> to platforms like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/07/smart-tv-platform-flingo-comes-out-of-stealth-to-merge-television-and-the-web/">Flingo</a>.</p>
<p>In most multi-billion dollar markets, we usually see a lot of hot M&amp;A activity and I suspect this expanded TV market (both hardware and software) will be no different.  There&#8217;s one company that has a ton of cash on their balance sheet lately that hasn&#8217;t been using it for acquisitions, though: Apple.</p>
<p>I came across a great <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-would-make-sense-for-Apple-to-use-its-51-billion-in-cash-for-a-strategic-acquisition">Quora post</a> the other day about how Apple uses their large cash balance to achieve an advantage in their supply chain for their new products.  I started thinking a lot about how Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/157247/2011/01/cook.html">strategy with the iPhone and iPad</a> might look should it decide to release an actual TV (as opposed to today&#8217;s AppleTV product).    <a href="http://cdixon.org/2011/04/17/apple-and-the-tv-industry/">Chris Dixon has already written an interesting post</a> about this (go read it if you haven&#8217;t yet), but in light of recent noise this week about how Apple&#8217;s release of a TV <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110712/apple-television-a-100-billion-opportunity/">could increase their market cap by $50B-100B</a>, I think it&#8217;s worth revisiting.  Whether the market cap figure ends up up being relevant or not, I&#8217;d be willing to bet that when Apple does choose to enter this industry, we&#8217;ll see them deploy those cash reserves in a similar way to what they&#8217;ve done in the past. In the large flat screen market, this may be even more of an advantageous and disruptive tactic.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, companies like Samsung and Sony<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704132204576284151007446010.html"> entered joint venture agreements</a> because the fixed costs of purchasing LCD factories are so high and they needed to share some risk (among other reasons). In the case of Apple, they can use their <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/04/26/2895/">incredible cash balance</a> to easily get exclusive rights to next-gen display factories that will help ensure their success in disrupting the digital TV market. Even as a late entrant, Apple is well poised to help capture a big piece of the pie.  <a href="http://cdixon.org/2011/04/17/apple-and-the-tv-industry/">As Chris Dixon says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Apple won’t enter the market due to its structure. But that didn’t stop them in mobile phones where the structure was similarly difficult. The mistake analysts made about the iPhone was to assume the current industry structure would be sustained after Apple’s entry. I’d be wary of making the same assumption about the TV industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingo. Apple has the cash position to do things that other TV manufacturers can&#8217;t do in their respective supply chains, and they&#8217;ll be able to tilt the industry structure in their favor as a result.  So, when will Apple release the TV? My guess is probably not until 2012, but I&#8217;m no oracle. And when they do release it, I sure can&#8217;t wait to fire up <a href="http://shelby.tv">Shelby</a> on it.</p>

      <p>I spent a good portion of this past weekend hanging out at <a href="http://gamehackday.org/">Game Hack Day NYC</a>. <em><strong>Big thanks to <a href="http://www.johndbritton.com/">John Britton</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adrianmryan">Adrian Ryan</a> @ General Assembly for organizing a really fun way to spend the weekend.</strong></em> It was a great event that made me think a lot about what hack days are all about and how these types of events are essential to the ecosystem of any growing startup community.</p>
<p>At their core, hack days are about celebrating creativity, education, and exploration in their most raw forms. It&#8217;s awesome to see first time hackers and veterans alike explore interesting ideas and then present them in front of their peers (regardless of outcome).  This weekend was no exception.  I had a blast checking out the various hardware and software hacks during the judging on Sunday.  For a full rundown of the hacks, check out the <a href="http://wiki.gamehackday.org/nyc11/show/HomePage">Game Hack Day Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I think it might be easy for a lot of non-engineering oriented people to dismiss programming and hacking as an uncreative, dry, and monotonous form of expression.  To those people: come check out the demos at the next hack day in your area and I think you&#8217;ll be surprised at how amazingly creative many of the hacks are.  Had I been exposed to events like this during my undergraduate days in computer science, I would been far more amped about pursuing a career as an engineer.</p>
<p>Need an example? <a href="http://mkrecny.com">Myles Recny</a>, a cohort of mine at Shelby.tv (and a self proclaimed cyborg from the future), created a mashup of Twitter and Tetris called <em><strong>Twetris</strong></em> (<a href="http://github.com/mkrecny/twetris">available on his github repo</a>) that landed him third place at the hack day.  Twetris plays the same as Tetris with one caveat - the user signs in with his/her Twitter account and each block that drops onto the playing field signifies a random group of other Twitter users that have actually been followed on Twitter.  In order to unfollow these people on Twitter, you have to clear rows of blocks just as in regular Tetris.  Sounds like a losing battle, but it&#8217;s a whole lot of fun and adds an amazing sense of urgency to the game.  Give it a try, and you just might end up with a bunch more Twitter followers (Myles contends that about <em>30% of followed users end up following back</em>).</p>

<p>At the end of the day (had to throw in a consulting phrase for posterity&#8230;), hack days are becoming increasingly popular in New York and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping plan one for later this fall.  While I&#8217;m not quite ready to let the cat completely out of the bag, check out <a href="http://hackday.tv">hackday.tv</a> for a taste of what&#8217;s to come.  If you have awesome ideas for something you&#8217;d like to see in a hack day event, shoot me an <a href="mailto://internzero@shelby.tv">email</a>.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve toyed around with the idea of doing a Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to NYC Tech (<a href="http://www.robgo.org/post/1525018376/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-boston-tech-community">much like Rob Go has done for the Boston community</a>) for a while now.  The New York tech community is growing like a weed and it&#8217;s becoming harder to keep track of everything going on.  Hopefully this guide will help students, aspiring techies, and veterans all find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">answer</a> to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.</p>
<p>Rather than compile all of the information into one gigantic post, I&#8217;ll be breaking things up into a series of posts which I will keep updated over time.  Feedback and thoughts are welcome in the comments!</p>
<p>To kick things off, here&#8217;s a list of incubators, co-working spaces, and accelerators in the New York City area.  I&#8217;ve included brief descriptions for each.  If there are any awesome places I&#8217;m missing, please leave a comment and let me know!</p>
