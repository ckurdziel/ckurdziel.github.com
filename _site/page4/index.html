      <p><img height="450" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1xqwgaa1Q1qaedq5.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<p>Recently, the real @<a href="http://twitter.com/fakegrimlock">FAKEGRIMLOCK</a> sat down with <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/03/31/breakfast-of-champions-meet-the-man-known-as-fakegrimlock/">The Next Web to talk</a> about why he does what he does:</p>
<blockquote>"It’s a proof of concept, it’s to prove a theory. And it’s to prove that who you are doesn’t matter. In fact, truth requires that you aren’t anyone, because if you’re someone, whatever you say is always biased. It’s influenced by what you know about that person&#8230;<br/><br/>&#8230;So the reason I have to be just a character is that there is no anything else. The words are just the words. And the words are funny and they are ridiculous, but they’re true. And the ridiculousness is to disarm you, so you forget even further. Forget what’s wrapped around it, forget your preconceived notions, forget what you think is going on, just listen to the words. Because I very, very purposefully craft those words to be hard to understand because I want you to stop and think about them. And by stopping and thinking about them, they get past all these filters. I’m completely hacking the social channel that we all rely on."</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see another pseudonym garner some serious attention from the press and so succinctly explain why he has chosen to remain anonymous.  </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Poole">moot</a> has some great thoughts on the importance of supporting pseudonyms and anonymity within internet services.  I agree with him that providing the option for pseudonyms can really help make the internet a more powerful tool for expression. If you haven&#8217;t seen moot talk about this sort of stuff, here&#8217;s a great primer:</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="337" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/e3Zs74IH0mc" width="600"></iframe></p>
<p>A few people have heard that I was lucky enough to have beers with The Grimster down at SXSW and chat about what he&#8217;s up to IRL.  Many have asked me about what the &#8220;real" GRIMLOCK is like. Honestly, I have to say that he didn&#8217;t reveal too much more than he has revealed to his fanbase online.  He could be a super famous VC/entrepreneur, a serial killer, a concert pianist, or just a regular dude (I have no idea).  To moot&#8217;s point in the video above, I don&#8217;t think much of that is really the point (well&#8230;maybe the serial killer bit does&#8230;). We just have to laugh and enjoy how FAKEGRIMLOCK chooses to express himself&#8230; OR ELSE!</p>
<p><em>For more FAKEGRIMLOCK goodness, check out <a href="http://projectgoats.com">projectGOATS.com</a> for some great interviews. And moot, if you read this, I think it would be awesome for you to interview FAKEGRIMLOCK&#8230;</em></p>

      <p>Yesterday I was driving to NYC with my buddy <a href="http://www.punylittlehuman.com/">Daniel</a> for <a href="http://www.blueprinthealth.org/">Blueprint Health Demo Day</a> and as usual, we spent most of the car ride discussing VC and the startup ecosystem.  Every time I travel with Daniel, he knocks me over the head with some amazing story about the rich history of the VC community.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s moment was regarding the origin of the limited partnership in VC. Essentially, a limited partnership was supposed first used by Bill Elfers when he left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Research_and_Development_Corporation">American Research and Development Corporation</a> (widely regarded as one of the first VC firms and an investor in Digital Equipment Corporation) to found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylock_Partners">Greylock Partners</a> in 1965. The limited partnership was <a href="http://www.scaruffi.com/svhistory/sv/chap78.html">supposedly something Elfers had seen</a> during his days in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcatter">oil wildcatting business</a>.</p>
<p>Stories like these may not fundamentally change my outlook on limited partnerships or their use in VC, but they provide color and richness to many aspects of a business that are taken for granted. What&#8217;s particularly interesting about these sorts of stories is that much of the startup ecosystem is so focused on the present and the future, rather than the past.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this is, but as a whole I think we need to spend more time making sense of and honoring the history of our community.  Real-time data feeds and the next big thing are great, but there&#8217;s so much that entrepreneurs, VCs, and even users can understand and learn from those that have come before us.  I love seeing startups like <a href="http://timehop.com/">Timehop</a> that are focused on collecting and organizing this historical data. Whether it&#8217;s through design approach, focus on historical data, or just through decision-making, I really hope we&#8217;ll see more startups show reverence to past.</p>

        Saying "No" Sucks

      <p>I had coffee with an awesome entrepreneur over the weekend and he said something that really got me thinking: &#8220;I hate hearing no."</p>
<p>Turns out that I hate <em>saying</em> no (and this can sometimes get me in trouble). I love the feeling of being a &#8220;yes" man, having a can do attitude, and making things happen that seem like they&#8217;re not possible, but sometimes there&#8217;s a real cost associated with saying &#8220;yes."  Business school has taught me a number of things, but one the most important lessons has been how to say &#8220;no" when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve had to deliver bad news entrepreneurs we can&#8217;t invest in, tell people I can&#8217;t carve out time for a meeting because I can&#8217;t be in multiple places at multiple times, and say no to extra work because I can&#8217;t quite get it all done. </p>
<p>This has been pretty frustrating, but ultimately, I think saying no to some things just means you can say yes to others. I&#8217;m not talking about that &#8220;kinda-sorta" yes that&#8217;s driven by FOMO (fear of missing out), dilutes your focus, leads to flaky scheduling and spreads you thin. Giving someone or something a real &#8220;yes" and committing to that yes means you can devote yourself to that thing and accomplish it well. </p>
<p>In its essence, I think this boils down to one thing: <em><strong>being present</strong></em>. Pick the things in life that really matter: your family, your friends, the people, work and art that truly inspires you. You don&#8217;t have to ignore everything else, but don&#8217;t say yes to anything that compromises the level of enjoyment or excellence that you get and give to those things that really matter.</p>

      <p><p class="p1">YouTube recently released stats that <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2012/01/holy-nyans-60-hours-per-minute-and-4.html">60+ hours of content are being uploaded to their site per minute</a>. That sort of data is pretty impressive, but when you take a look at a lot of that content, it becomes a little less impressive. I&#8217;ve noticed an increasing amount of video responses to popular videos on YouTube that feature women with low cut shirts in the thumbnails blathering on about whatever video they&#8217;re responding to. This sort of content is not exactly enhancing the community at YouTube, so I can only assume these types of people are trying to cash in on ad revenue via traffic from the videos they&#8217;re responding to. </p>
<p class="p1">Linkbait is nothing new and I&#8217;m not the only one who has noticed this, but I was recently reminded of all this because of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJHzbXEc2so">video from reddit</a> the other day. This guy isn&#8217;t the most articulate speaker, but he makes his point pretty well. </p>
<p class="p1">Problems like this one indicate that communities and curation have become increasingly important in the online world. At <a href="http://Shelby.tv/"><span class="s1">Shelby.tv</span></a>, as we think about the future of what video community should look like, we are building the type of community that doesn&#8217;t promote the &#8220;spammy" user-generated-content (UGC) that we see on places like YouTube. Recommendations and organic UGC are great, but recommendations (especially as related to the long tail of UGC) powered without a social filter or strong context around them feel empty, spammy and often result in the lower quality kind of stuff I&#8217;m referring to here.  </p>
<p class="p1">We believe the social filter is the key to building a community of content that doesn&#8217;t promote this sort of abusive behavior and we&#8217;re really excited about sharing what we&#8217;re building with the rest of the world.  More on this soon. ;)</p></p>

        How should startups approach CES?

      <p><p class="p1">I (and the rest of team Shelby) recently attended CES, the largest consumer electronics show in the world.  It was my first time going to such a huge event, so consequently, it was also my first time navigating the waters of a trade show that is largely geared toward large companies rather than small startups. In an effort to make things more accessible to the startups interested in attending CES in the future, I thought <span class="s1">I&#8217;d share some of the questions I had as we planned for CES</span>.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Do we need to have a booth at CES?  </strong>Depends on what your goals <span class="s1">are&#8212;the</span> booth was useful for us because we are a consumer web startup and need to be visible. Not only did we attract investors and potential business partners, but we attracted users and were able to test different aspects of our pitch on them. In this sense, the booth was <span class="s1">invaluable.</span> If you&#8217;re not a <span class="s1">consumer-facing</span> startup and are on a tight budget, a booth may not be worth it (unless you can get it for free like we did). You&#8217;re still better off with some kind of meeting place to gather at (could be a hotel room) and schedule BD meetings for, and you&#8217;ll have to get more creative about how you generate awareness around your startup.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>How much money do we need? </strong><span class="s1">Cost</span> can vary greatly between companies, <span class="s1">so it&#8217;s hard to provide a straight answer on this one</span>. If you&#8217;re a small startup under 10 employees and on a tight budget, it&#8217;s possible to scrap together stuff pretty cheaply.  The biggest expenses will be airfare, <span class="s1">hotel, and</span> official CES expenses (booth &amp; press events if you choose to get pay for these).</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>What sort of stuff should we pay <span class="s1">for, and what should</span> we try to get for free? How does a startup get the most ROI for the least cost at an event where many of the vendors have deep pockets?  </strong>Staying close to the action was really important to us. <span class="s1">If</span> you&#8217;re planning on taking <span class="s1">meetings</span>, the right hotel room can also double as <span class="s1">space for that; consider </span>ponying up for the right room.  Almost everything at <span class="s1">CES</span> (from carpet in the booth to press releases through the CEA) costs money. Figure out what your priorities are ahead of time and optimize your spend accordingly.  That said, little things like upgrading to nicer carpet in the booth can make a big difference when you&#8217;re on your feet 16+ hours a day.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Other tips?</strong> In the weeks prior to CES, schedule the meetings you can for the afternoons to take place in your suite or booth. This timing allows you to hunt down other people during your mornings on the show floor<span class="s2">.  Also, </span><span class="s1">only send the </span>number of employees that is right for you&#8212;we found 4 at the booth was pretty ideal. We had at least 2 people pitching at a <span class="s1">time,</span> but the extra two often helped pull in additional onlookers <span class="s1">and </span>generate more buzz around our booth (or were available to go scout other booths).  Our neighbors started coming over to check us out because of the volume of traffic that we attracted <span class="s1">as a team</span>. </li>
</ul><div><em><strong>Overall recommendation:</strong></em> be creative! There are a lot of low budget (but interesting) ways to engage people at CES and other trade shows.  This is what being a startup is all about, so be comfortable in your own skin and people will love it!</div>
<p class="p1">The questions above aren&#8217;t exhaustive, but they&#8217;re pretty representative of the stuff we thought about this year and hopefully will be helpful to startups in the future that attend CES. A lot of people may think CES is a waste of time, and while it might be if you approach it incorrectly, there&#8217;s a lot to be learned and achieved if you approach things with an <span class="s1">open, but focused, mind.  More thoughts on how to crush CES?  Leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add to the list!</span></p></p>
