I've been fortunate enough to travel a bunch over the course of my life. I started out by visiting all 50 US states, but recently Iâ€™ve been focused on traveling internationally.

For each trip I take, I compile suggestions/itineraries from friends who have been there. They're all up on my website/GitHub so you can add your own suggestions to the list.

Here are a few places I've been.
 - United States (all 50 states)
 - Canada: Banff, Jasper & Yoho National Parks
 - Chile: San Pedro de Atacama
 - Chilean Patagonia: Torres del Paine
 - Peru: Lima, The Sacred Valley & trek to Machu Picchu
 - Iceland: Drive the Ring Road
 - Italy: Lake Como, Venice & The Dolomites
- Amsterdam & The Netherlands

Places On My Travel List:

 - Nepal
 - South Africa
 - Antarctica
 - Svalbard, Norway
