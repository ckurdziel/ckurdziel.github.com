I like playing DOTA2 in my free time. Here is some advice for new players and a training regimen I recommend (courtesy of the DOTA2 subreddit).

# The Basics

## Positions 1-5
Typically players refer to their hero by a "position" they play - a number of 1 thru 5. This refers to the amount of "farm" (gold) that a player amasses in the course of the game. Position 1 typically gets the most farm and on down.

## Roles
1. Core: Core typically refers to position 1-3. These are typically a "carry" (position 1/2) and an "offlane" (position 3). A note on the offlane: the goal of players in the offlane is mostly to disrupt gameplay of the enemy safelane and support. This can be done a variety of different ways, but most offlaners are tanky (lots of hp) and able to lane alone without a support if the offlane support role needs to roam the map to help the other cores. 

2. Support: Supports typically are position 4/5. Supports are much more concerned with the macro than the micro and on making sure carries are farming well. They take care of things like warding, carrying dust and smoke. Supports themselves don't require a lot of farm to be useful - they generally have strong abilities that don't need items to scale. As such, good item builds focus more on supporting the team and making sure that supports still have the ability to use their abilities (things like BKB) vs gaining dps or damage.

## Phases of the Game
1. Laning: the goal of this phase is gaining levels and gold (especially for carries). This is generally the focus of the beginning few minutes of the game.
2. Ganking: this phase of the game is ongoing but focuses on catching enemy heroes out of position or farming, thus leading to a "man up" situation where a team can either start a team fight or proceed with pushing an objective. 
3. Pushing: this phase of the game is about taking objectives (towers and barracks) together as a team. Generally at this point, cores are already farmed and there's some momentum that a team has generated (via a gank or otherwise).

# The Macro

DOTA is a game that initially appears like it focuses on the micro (last hits and creep kills) vs. the macro (positioning on the map, teamwork, strategy and hero picks). I've been playing for a while and I've learned that the macro is actually a really critically important piece of playing DOTA well. I've made the mistake of focusing too much on the micro so be aware of what is happening on the macro level and you'll have a much better head for winning.

# DOTA2 Micro Challenge
This is a useful challenge that is helpful for improving your micro in the DOTA game. Keep in mind a lot of the game is macro, so this only gets you so far.

**Easy:**
1. 10 min- no creeps missed (80+ lasthits minimum)
2. 10 min- 80 lh/40 deny safelane, creeps can't enter either team's tower. if they do you reset
3. 10 min- 100 LH
4. 30 min- 600 LH
5. Less than 10 min- end the game(destroy enemy ancient)
6. 3000+ score in last hit trainer

**Advanced:**
1. 10 min- 120 LH
2. 30 min- 900 LH
3. 10 min- 100 CS+(LH+DN counts) as morphling -\> lvl 1 strenght morph and never level anything again, turn it on and don't turn it off. Buy a branch, a faerie and a wraith band, you'll constantly have only 25 damage.
4. Less than 8 min- end the game(destroy enemy ancient)
5. 3500+ score in last hit trainer

**Super advanced:**
1. 10 min - 170 LH
2. 30 min - 1300 LH
3. 10 min- 120 CS+(LH+DN counts) as morphling -\> lvl 1 strenght morph and never level anything again, turn it on and don't turn it off. Buy a branch, a faerie and a wraith band, you'll constantly have only 25 damage.
4. less than 6 min - end the game (destroy enemy ancient)
5. 3600 score in last hit trainer, 2 times in a row. No tiny, shaman, tree.
