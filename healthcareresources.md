Here's a quick list of some interesting healthcare resources I keep track of.

#### Healthcare Technology Landscape & Fundraising

 - [The Health Tech Ecosystem](http://www.slideshare.net/wendombrowski/the-health-tech-ecosystem-24011408/) - A nice 2 slide overview of different players in the healthcare techology ecosystem.

#### General Healthcare Data & IT:
